Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    You should read the following discussion and analysis and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors,” under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing first-in-class drugs targeting 
micro
RNAs to treat diseases with significant unmet medical need. We were formed in 2007 when Alnylam and Ionis contributed significant intellectual property, know-how and financial and human capital to pursue the development of drugs targeting 
micro
RNAs pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement. Our most advanced product candidates are RG-012 and RGLS4326. RG-012 is an anti-miR targeting miR-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease with no approved therapy available. In November 2018, we and Sanofi agreed to transition further development activities of our miR-21 programs, including our RG-012 program, to Sanofi. As a result, Sanofi became responsible for all costs incurred in the development of our miR programs. The transition activities were completed in the second quarter of 2019. RGLS4326 is an anti-miR targeting miR-17 for the treatment of ADPKD. In addition to these clinical programs, we continue to develop a pipeline of preclinical drug product candidates. 
Since our inception through December 31, 2020, we have relied primarily on the sale of our equity and convertible debt securities to fund company operations. We have received $361.8 million from the sale of our equity and convertible debt securities, $101.8 million from our collaborations, principally from upfront payments, research funding and preclinical and clinical milestones, and $19.8 million in net proceeds from our Term Loan. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $31.1 million. 
FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW
Revenue
Our revenues generally consist of upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, milestone payments and payments for other research services under collaboration agreements.
In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of license fees and other upfront payments, payments for research and development services, milestone payments, product sales and royalties in connection with strategic collaborations. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of our achievement of preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones, if at all, the timing and amount of payments relating to such milestones and the extent to which any of our products are approved and successfully commercialized by us or our strategic collaboration partners. If our current or future collaboration partners do not elect or otherwise agree to fund our development costs pursuant to our current or future strategic collaboration agreements, or we or our strategic collaboration partner fails to develop product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenues, and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.
Research and development expenses
53
Table of Contents 
Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our therapeutic programs. Our research and development expenses include:
 
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;
•
external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, other clinical trial related vendors, consultants and our scientific advisors;
•
license fees; and
•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, amortization of leasehold improvements and equipment, and laboratory and other supplies.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. Certain of the raw materials used in the process of manufacturing drug product are capitalized upon their acquisition and expensed upon usage, as we have determined these materials have alternative future use.
To date, we have conducted research on many different 
micro
RNAs with the goal of understanding how they function and identifying those that might be targets for therapeutic modulation. At any given time we are working on multiple targets, primarily within our therapeutic areas of focus. Our organization is structured to allow the rapid deployment and shifting of resources to focus on the most promising targets based on our ongoing research. As a result, in the early phase of our development programs, our research and development costs are not tied to any specific target. However, we are currently spending the vast majority of our research and development resources on our lead development programs.
Since our inception, we have incurred a total of appro
ximately $373.4 million in research and development expenses through December 31, 2020.
The process of conducting clinical trials and preclini
cal studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We, or our strategic collaboration partners, may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. The probability of success for each product candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.
Successful development of future product candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each future product candidate and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to our ability to maintain or enter into new collaborations with respect to each program or potential product candidate, the scientific and clinical success of each future product candidate, as well as ongoing assessments as to each future product candidate’s commercial potential. We will need to raise additional capital and may seek additional collaborations in the future in order to advance our various programs.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, legal, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, some of which are incurred as a result of being a publicly-traded company. 
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income and expense and various income or expense items of a non-recurring nature. We earn interest income from interest-bearing accounts and money market funds for cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, such as interest-bearing bonds, for our short-term investments. Interest expense is primarily attributable to interest charges associated with borrowings under our secured Term Loan. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the revenues and expenses incurred during 
54
Table of Contents 
the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. 
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues generally consist of upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, milestone payments and payments for other research services under license and collaboration agreements. 
We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation(s). At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and identify those that are
 
performance obligations. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
Collaborative Arrangements
We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial milestones; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non-refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as contract liabilities and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.
As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligation(s). The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied at a point in time, or over time. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.
License Fees
If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other performance obligations, we use judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether it is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Milestone Payments
55
Table of Contents 
At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price. If it is probable that a milestone event would occur at the inception of an arrangement, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are contingent upon the achievement of events that are uncertain or not controllable, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received, and therefore not included in the transaction price. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint(s), and if necessary, may adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which could affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
Royalties
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our collaborative arrangements.
Clinical Trial and Preclinical Study Accruals
We make estimates of our accrued expenses for clinical trial and preclinical study activities as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. These accruals are based upon estimates of costs incurred and fees that may be associated with services provided by clinical trial investigational sites, CROs and for other clinical trial-related activities. Payments under certain contracts with such parties depend on factors such as successful enrollment of patients, site initiation and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing for these services, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If possible, we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from these service providers. However, we may be required to estimate these services based on other information available to us. If we underestimate or overestimate the activities or fees associated with a study or service at a given point in time, adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods. Historically, our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals.

Table of Contents 
Our revenues are generated from ongoing collaborations, and generally consist of upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, milestone payments, program material sales payments and payments for other research services. Revenue under collaborations was $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to the recognition of the Enrollment Milestone under the 2020 Sanofi Amendment and the recognition of program-related materials under the 2020 Sanofi Amendment as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Research and development expenses increased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The aggregate increase was driven by a $3.5 million increase in external development costs, primarily attributable to the fact that FDA lifted the partial clinical hold on the RGLS4326 Phase 1 MAD study in December 2019 and we recommenced that study in February 2020, with the final dosing completed in July 2020. Further contributing to the increase in external development costs were costs associated with activities leading up to, and including, patient dosing in our RGLS4326 Phase 1b study, with the first patient having been dosed in October 2020.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts reflect personnel-related and ongoing general business operating costs. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, are primarily attributable to continued cost reduction efforts subsequent our corporate restructurings.
Interest and other expenses, net
Net interest and other expenses were $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts are primarily related to interest charges associated with our outstanding Term Loan.
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes we are a going concern, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from any uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.  
If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the needed financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of the Company’s existing stockholders. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including: 
•
whether and when we achieve any of the remaining milestones under our collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi; 
•
the terms and timing of any other strategic collaboration, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; 
57
Table of Contents 
•
the initiation, progress, timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our development programs and product candidates, and associated costs; 
•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 
•
the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals; 
•
delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements; 
•
the cost and timing of hiring new employees; 
•
the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims; 
•
the costs and timing of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates; 
•
the costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and the pricing and reimbursement for any products for which we may receive regulatory approval;
•
the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies;
•
the extent to which our PPP Loan is forgiven; and
•
payments under our Term Loan.

Net cash used in operating activities decreased to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash used in operating activities were primarily attributable to net losses of $15.7 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Adjustments for non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation, decreased to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in working capital resulted in net cash used in operating activities of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the acquisition of intangible assets. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the sale of property and equipment. 
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to total net proceeds received from our private placement of common stock, warrants to purchase common stock and non-voting convertible preferred stock in December 2020 of $18.2 million, partially offset by the remittance of $10.0 million of principal amortization payments under our Term Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was attributable to total net proceeds received from our private placement of common stock, warrants to purchase common stock and non-voting convertible preferred stock in May 2019 and December 2019 of $40.1 million.
