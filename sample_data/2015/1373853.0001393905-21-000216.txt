Overview
 
We were incorporated as “Atheron, Inc.” in the State of Nevada on May 8, 2006. On November 5, 2010 we underwent a change of control and on November 15, 2010 we changed our name to New America Energy Corp., and began looking for opportunities to acquire exploration stage oil and gas or mineral properties. Also on November 15, 2010 we effected a split of our issued and outstanding common shares on a 25 for 1 basis. This forward split did not affect the number of our company’s authorized common shares, which remains at 75,000,000. The forward stock split and name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on December 1, 2010 under the symbol “NECA”. Our CUSIP number is . Our mailing address is 240 Vaughan Drive, Alpharetta GA  30009. Our telephone number is 470-767-8794.
 
On September 17, 2013, the Company made a decision to change its business model and decided to enter the short-term loan business. In order to do this, the company acquired Title King LLC (“Title King”), a 100% owned subsidiary. Title King provides short-term high interest loans to consumers through the collateral use of car and truck titles. Title King operates in the alternative financial services industry, providing automobile title loans to consumers who their own vehicle free and clear and need convenient and simple access to funds. On September 27, 2013, the company issued to its Chief Executive Officer a Series A Preferred, which guarantees him majority voting rights.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are currently involved in the issuance of short term loans collateralized by automobiles.
