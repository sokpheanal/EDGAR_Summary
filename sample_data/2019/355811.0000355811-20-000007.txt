Results of Operations: 2019 to 2018
Net Sales.
 In 2019, Company net sales 
increased
 by 
$24.8 million
, or 
1%
 compared to the prior year.  Net sales for 2019 were negatively impacted by: lower than forecasted global vehicle production rates for calendar year 2019, which were down 6% on a a year over year basis; and by approximately 1% from the strike at General Motors which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019. Despite these negative impacts, automotive net sales increased as a result of a 
3%
 increase in automatic-dimming mirror shipments, from 
41.6 million
 units in 2018 to 
42.9 million
 units in 2019, due more so to growth within the Company's domestic market than its international markets.  North American automotive mirror shipments increased 8% in 2019 when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased penetration of exterior automatic-dimming mirrors. 
Other net sales increased 
13%
 to 
$48.4 million
 compared to the prior year, as dimmable aircraft window sales increased 19% year over year and fire protection saw an increase in net sales of 7% year over year.
Cost of Goods Sold.
  As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold 
increased
 from 
62.4%
 in 2018 to 
63.0%
 in 2019, primarily due to annual customer price reductions that were not fully offset with purchasing cost reductions, as well as an increase in costs related to tariffs.  Annual price reductions and tariffs independently impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 75 - 200 basis points.  These negative impacts were partially offset by the impact of purchasing cost reductions and product mix impacts that independently impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 75 - 150 basis points. 
Operating Expenses.
  Engineering, research and development expenses 
increased
 by 
$7.6 million
 or 7% from 2018 to 2019, but remained at 
6%
 of net sales. E, R & D 
increased
, primarily due to increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and launch of new business, as well as development of new products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
increased
 by 
$9.9 million
 or 
13%
 from 2018 to 2019, representing 
5%
 of net sales in 2019 versus 4% of net sales in 2018. The primary reason for the increase from 2018 to 2019 was due to increased staffing levels, travel expenses, and professional fees.
18
Total Other Income/(Expense).
  Investment income remained at $11.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Other income – net 
decreased
 
$2.0 million
 in 2019 versus 2018, primarily due to a decrease in gains on sales of debt investments on a year over year basis.
Taxes.
 
The effective tax rate was 
15.1%
 for year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 
16.1%
 the prior year. The effective tax rates in 2019 and 2018 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction.  In 2019, the effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate also primarily due to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction. The decrease in the effective tax rate year over year primarily relates to increase in the benefits derived from the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction, Research & Development Credit and Stock Compensation Expense. 
Net Income.
 Net income 
decreased
 by 
$13.2 million
, or 
3%
 year over year, primarily due to the decrease in gross margin and increases in operating expenses primarily related to increased staffing levels.
Results of Operations: 2018 to 2017
Net Sales.
 In 2018, Company net sales increased by $39.2 million, or 2% compared to the prior year.  Automotive net sales increased due to a 6% increase in automatic-dimming mirror shipments, from 39.3 million units in 2017 to 41.6 million units in 2018, primarily reflecting increased overall penetration of automatic-dimming mirrors, primarily within the Company's international markets.  International automotive mirror unit shipments increased 7% in 2018 when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased penetration of both interior and exterior automatic dimming mirrors to certain European and Japanese automakers. 
Other net sales increase 17% to $42.9 million compared to the prior year,  as dimmable aircraft window sales increased 16% year over year, and fire protection saw an increase in net sales of 8% year over year.
Cost of Goods Sold.
  As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased from 61.3% in 2017 to 62.4% in 2018, primarily due to annual customer price reductions that were not fully offset with purchasing cost reductions, as well as the Company's inability to leverage fixed overhead costs due to lower than expected sales levels.  Annual price reductions and fixed overhead costs independently impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 75 - 150 basis points. These negative impacts were partially offset by the impact of purchasing cost reductions of 50 - 75 basis points.
Operating Expenses.
  Engineering, research and development expenses increased by $7.4 million or 7% from 2017 to 2018, but remained at 6% of net sales. E, R & D increased, primarily due to increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and launch of new business as well as development of new products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million or 5% from 2017 to 2018, but remained at 4% of net sales. The primary reason for the increase from 2017 to 2018 was due to increased staffing levels and travel expenses.
Total Other Income/(Expense).
  
Investment income increased $1.8 million in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to higher interest rates available for the Company's investable funds. Other income – net increased $3.7 million in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to  decreased interest expense associated with the Company's debt financing, as discussed further in 
Note 2
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Taxes.
 
The effective tax rate was 16.1% for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 23.5% the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 and 2018 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction as well as the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Act").  In 2018, the effective tax rate differed from the new statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction.  The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2018 from the prior year was due to the change in statutory tax rate as passed in the Act to 21% from 35%.
Net Income.
 Net income increased by $31.1 million, or 8% year over year, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate on a year over year basis.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s financial condition throughout the periods presented has remained very strong, in spite of a 6% decline in global light vehicle production from 2018 to 2019.
The Company's cash and cash equivalents were 
$296.3 million
, 
$217.0 million
 and 
$569.7 million
 as of 
December 31, 2019
, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's cash and cash equivalents include amounts held by foreign subsidiaries of $8.5 million, $8.3 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
The Company's current ratio 
increased
 from 
5.0
 as of December 31, 2018 to 
5.5
 as of 
December 31, 2019
, reflecting the increase in working capital. The Company's current ratio increased from 4.9 as of December 31, 2017, to 5.0 as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the repayment of $78 million of the Company's long term debt, that was offset by share repurchases discussed herein.
Cash flow from operating activities was 
$506.0 million
, 
$552.4 million
 and 
$501.0 million
 for the years ended 
December 31, 2019
, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Cash flow from operating activities 
decreased
 
$46.5 million
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2019
 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased net income and changes in working capital.  Cash flow from operating activities increased $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased net income which was partially offset by changes in working capital.
Cash flow used for investing activities for the year ended 
December 31, 2019
 decreased by 
$129.1 million
 to 
$56.7 million
, compared with 
$185.8 million
, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreased investment purchases, which was partially offset by a decrease in fixed income investment maturities during the year. Cash flow used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $108.1 million to $185.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased investment purchases during the year.  
Capital expenditures were 
$84.6 million
, 
$86.0 million
, and $104.0 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2019
, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year ended 2019 remained consistent with the year ended 2018, however, capital expenditures decreased by $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreases in production equipment purchases and building related costs.
Cash flow used for financing activities for the year ended 
December 31, 2019
, decreased 
$349.3 million
 to 
$370.0 million
, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in the amount of shares of common stock repurchased which totaled 
$331.5 million
 during the calendar year 2019 as compared to $719.3 million during the calendar year 2018. Cash flow used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $319.3 million to $719.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $591.6 million during the calendar year 2018 compared to $231.4 million during the calendar year 2017.
Short-term investments as of 
December 31, 2019
 were 
$140.4 million
, down from 
$169.4 million
 as of December 31, 2018 and long-term investments were 
$139.9 million
 as of 
December 31, 2019
, up from 
$138.0 million
 as of December 31, 2018, due to changes in the Company's overall investment portfolio.
Accounts receivable as of 
December 31, 2019
 
increased
 
$21.9 million
 compared to 
December 31, 2018
, primarily due to the timing of sales within each of the comparable periods.
Inventories as of 
December 31, 2019
, 
increased
 
$23.7 million
 compared to 
December 31, 2018
, primarily due to increased raw material inventory levels to support first quarter 2020 production and sales forecasts, as well as higher levels of component inventory with longer lead-times.
Intangible Assets, net as of 
December 31, 2019
 
decreased
 
$19.3 million
 compared to 
December 31, 2018
, due to the amortization of definite lived intangible assets and patents, discussed further in in 
Note 10
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounts payable as of 
December 31, 2019
, 
increased
 
$4.7 million
 compared to 
December 31, 2018
, primarily due the timing of inventory and capital expenditure payments.
Management considers the Company’s current working capital and long-term investments, as well as its existing credit financing arrangement (notwithstanding covenants prohibiting additional indebtedness), discussed further in 
Note 2
 o
20
f the Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to internally generated cash flow, to be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future considering its contractual obligations and commitments. The following is a summary of working capital and long-term investments:

The increase in working capital as of December 31, 2019 is primarily due to cash flow from operations, which was partially offset by share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures. The decrease in working capital as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 is primarily due to increased share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures, which in combination were more than provided by cash flow from operations.

Part II, Item 5
, with regard to the Company's previously announced share repurchase plan.
Outlook
The Company utilizes the light vehicle production forecasting services of IHS Markit. IHS Markit current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar year 2020 are approximately 16.5 million units for North America, 20.7 million units for Europe, 12.9 million units for Japan and Korea, and 24.4 million units for China. 
The Company currently estimates that top line revenue for calendar year 2020 will be between $1.91 and $2.0 billion. All estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the primary regions to which the Company ships product, as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix. The Company continues to see order rates and booked business that allow for these estimates an expected vehicle production decrease in 2020 and only a modest increase in 2021 compared to 2020.  Continuing uncertainties, including: light vehicle production levels; supplier part or material shortages; automotive plant shutdowns; sales rates in Europe, Asia and North America; challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including tariffs; OEM strategies and cost pressures; customer inventory management and the impact of potential automotive customer (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and supplier bankruptcies; work stoppages, coronavirus, strikes, etc., which could disrupt shipments to these customers, make forecasting difficult. 
The Company is estimating that the gross profit margin will be between 36% and 37% for calendar year 2020.  Historically, annual customer price reductions have placed significant pressure on gross margin on an annual basis.  Given the current revenue forecast and projected product mix for 2020, the Company hopes it may be able to offset certain annual customer price reductions with purchasing cost reductions and operational efficiencies, but there is no certainty of being able to do so.
The Company also currently estimates that its operating expenses, which include engineering, research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to be between $205 and $215 million for calendar year 2020, due in part to increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and launch of new business as well as development of new products. The Company continues to invest heavily in technology directed at funding the development of its current product portfolio and create iterations of those products that help keep its products new and attractive to our customers. In addition, the Company has been investing heavily in the next wave of innovation, many of which were shown for the first time in 2020, and included new products for automotive, aerospace and  developments in intelligent medical lighting.
The Company is a technology leader in the automotive industry, with a focus on developing uniquely designed solutions that are highly proprietary. The Company continues to make investments intended to maintain a competitive advantage in its current market as well as to use its core competencies to develop products that are applicable in other markets.
In light of on-going demand for our automatic-dimming mirrors and electronics, the Company currently anticipates that 2020 capital expenditures will be between $85 and $95 million, a majority of which will be production equipment purchases. Capital expenditures for calendar year 2020 are currently anticipated to be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operating activities.
21
The Company also estimates that depreciation and amortization expense for calendar year 2020 will be between $105 and $110 million.
The Company is further estimating that its tax rate will be between 15.0% and 17.0% for calendar year 2020.
In accordance with its previously announced share repurchase plan and capital allocation strategy, the Company  intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in 2020 and into the future depending on a number of factors, including: market, economic, and industry conditions; the market price of the Company's common stock; anti-dilutive effect on earnings; available cash; and other factors that the Company deems appropriate. 
The Company is also providing top line revenue guidance for calendar year 2021. IHS Markit current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar year 2021 are approximately 16.5 million units for North America, 21.2 million units for Europe,12.6 million units for Japan and Korea, and 25.3 million units for China. Based on these forecasts, the Company is estimating that revenue for calendar year 2021 will increase approximately 3% to 8% over current estimates provided for 2020 revenue.  As noted above, continuing uncertainties make forecasting difficult.
Market Risk Disclosure
The Company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities, including foreign exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk.  Fluctuating interest rates and securities prices could negatively impact the Company's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments.  The Company does not currently believe such risks are material.
The Company has some assets, liabilities and operations outside the United States, including multi-currency accounts, which currently are not significant overall to the Company as a whole. Because the Company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions, it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products.
Most of the Company’s non-U.S. sales are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars; during calendar year 2019, approximately 7% of the Company’s net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies (compared to 8% for calendar year 2018 and 8% for calendar year 2017). The Company currently expects that approximately 7% of the Company’s net sales in calendar year 2020 will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies. The Company does not currently engage in hedging activities of foreign currencies.
The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See the 
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
 below.

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates, assumptions and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions.  Management also continually reviews its accounting policies and financial information disclosures.  
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in 
Note 1
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. However, these estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty. As a result, actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates, as is the case in any application of generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
• It requires management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of the estimate, and
• Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. Accordingly, revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services when it transfers those goods or services to customers. Sales are shown net of returns, which have not historically been significant. The Company does not generate sales from arrangements with multiple deliverables. The Company generally receives purchase orders from customers on an annual basis. Typically, such purchase order provide the annual terms, including pricing, related to a particular vehicle model. Purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. The Company recognizes revenue based on the pricing terms included in our annual purchase orders.  
As part of certain agreements, entered into in the ordinary course of business, the Company is asked to provide customers with annual price reductions.  Such amounts are estimated and accrued as a reduction of revenue as products are shipped to those customers.  For any shipments of product that may be subject to retroactive price adjustments that are then being negotiated, the Company records revenue based on the Company’s best estimate of the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer.  The Company's best estimate requires significant judgment based on historical results and expected outcomes of ongoing negotiations with customers.  The Company's approach is to consider these adjustments to the contract price as variable consideration which is estimated based on the then most likely price amount.  In addition, the Company has ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with customers based on the related content, the cost of our products and other commercial factors. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers.
