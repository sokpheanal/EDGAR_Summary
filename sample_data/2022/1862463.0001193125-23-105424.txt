Overview 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on April 20, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination that we have not yet identified. Our sponsor is Insight Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). 
 
60 
 

 
Our registration statement for our IPO was declared effective on September 1, 2021. On September 7, 2021, we consummated an IPO of 24,000,000 Units (and with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $240.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $17.5 million, of which approximately $12.0 million and approximately $668,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions and offering costs allocated to derivate warrant liabilities, respectively. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 7,500,000 and 1,200,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), to the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Odeon Group, LLC, respectively, for an aggregate of 8,700,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating proceeds of $8.7 million. 
Upon the closing of the IPO and the Private Placement, $241.2 million ($10.05 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and of the Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 
2a-7
Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. 
If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by May 7, 2023 (the “Combination Period”), which may be extended by our board of directors in their sole discretion on a monthly basis up to and including to September 7, 2023, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a 
per-share
We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. 
The issuance of additional shares in a Business Combination: 
 




 
•
 
 
may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our IPO, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B common stock resulted in the issuance of Class A common stock on a greater than 
one-to-one
 




 
•
 
 
may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A common stock if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A common stock; 
 




 
•
 
 
could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 
 




 
•
 
 
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 
 




 
•
 
 
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock. 
Similarly, if we issue debt or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in: 
 




 
•
 
 
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
 
61 
 







 
•
 
 
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
 




 
•
 
 
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 
 




 
•
 
 
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding; 
 




 
•
 
 
our inability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock; 
 




 
•
 
 
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 




 
•
 
 
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 
 




 
•
 
 
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 
 




 
•
 
 
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
Proposed Business Combination 
On April 3, 2023, Insight Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“SPAC”), Avila Amalco Sub Inc., an Alberta corporation (“Amalco Sub”) and Avila Energy Corporation, an Alberta corporation (“Avila”), entered into a business combination agreement and plan of merger (the “BCA”) pursuant to which SPAC will acquire Avila for consideration of shares in SPAC following its redomicile into the Province of Alberta (as further explained below). The terms of the BCA, which contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions and other terms relating to the mergers and the other transactions contemplated thereby, are summarized below. The Company’s entry into the BCA was previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed on April 4, 2023, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $172,000 in our operating bank account, and working capital deficit of approximately $360,000, excluding the accrued franchise tax. 
Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO were satisfied through the payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to cover for certain offering costs on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of the Founder Shares, and the loan from the Sponsor of approximately $163,000 under the Note. We repaid $157,000 of the Note balance on September 7, 2021 and repaid the remaining balance of approximately $6,000 in full on September 13, 2021, at which time the Note was terminated. Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, our liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.

Risks and Uncertainties 
Management continues to evaluate the impact of the

In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The specific impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. 
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise will depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination. 
Results of Operations 
Our entire activity since inception up to December 31, 2022 was in preparation for our formation and the IPO, and subsequent to the IPO, the search for a business combination target. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of approximately $11.9 million, which consisted of $10.7 million change in the fair value of derivative warrant liabilities and approximately $3.3 million of net (gain) loss on investments held in Trust Account partially offset by approximately $1.3 million in general and administrative costs, income tax expense of approximately $625,000 and approximately $206,000 franchise tax expenses. 
For the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net income of approximately $995,000, which consisted of $2.2 million change in the fair value of derivative warrant liabilities partially offset by approximately $668,000 in financing costs, approximately $453,000 in general and administrative costs and $140,000 franchise tax expenses. 
Contractual Obligations 
Registration Rights 
The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares), are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and stockholder rights agreement signed prior to the consummation of the IPO. These holders are entitled to certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 
Underwriting Agreement 
The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit, or $4.8 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the IPO. An additional fee of $0.50 per unit, or $12.0 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option was fully exercised, $0.70 per over-allotment unit, or up to an additional approximately $2.5 million, or approximately $14.5 million in the aggregate, would have been deposited in the Trust Account as deferred underwriting commissions. On October 16, 2021, the over-allotment option expired unexercised. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

Services Agreement 
On September 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement with the Sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to or incurred by members of our management team until the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination and the Company’s liquidation. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we incurred approximately $120,000 and $40,000, respectively, under the services agreement in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $40,000 and $10,000, respectively, was included in Accrued expenses—related party on our balance sheets. 
The board of directors has also approved payments of up to $15,000 per month, through the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, to members of our management team for services rendered to us. In addition, the Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any 
out-of-pocket
Critical Accounting Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company has not identified any critical accounting estimates. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 
Off-Balance
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any 
off-balance
S-K.
JOBS Act 
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for 
non-emerging
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of 
non-emerging

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal period ended December 31, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 
13a-15(e)
15d-15(e)
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Management identified two signifcant deficiencies that resulted in immaterial revisions to its previously reported financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the quarterly unaudited financial statements contained in its Form 10Qs for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022. The revisions are reported in Note 2 to the financial statements reported in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K contained herein. The signifcant deficiencies related to a missed adjustment for shares that were forfeited on October 16, 2021 and a calculation error in the supporting documents for the Company’s income tax footnote. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 
15d-15(f)
