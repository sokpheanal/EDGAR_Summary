and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this 10-K that does not consist of historical
facts are "forward-looking statements." Statements accompanied or qualified by, or containing, words such as "may,"
"will," "should," "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects,"
"estimates," "predicts," "potential," "outlook," "forecast," "anticipates,"
"presume," "assume" and "optimistic" constitute forward-looking statements and, as such, are not
a guarantee of future performance. The statements involve factors, risks and uncertainties, the impact or occurrence of which can
cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in such statements. Risks and uncertainties can include,
among others, fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions; variations in timing and amount of customer
orders; changing product demand and industry capacity; increased competition and pricing pressures; advances in technology that
can reduce the demand for the Company's products, as well as other factors, many or all of which may be beyond the Company's control.
Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results. The Company
disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to the forward-looking statements herein to reflect any change
in the Company's expectations with regard thereto, or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement

Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates
 
The Company's consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of the Company's
financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported. These estimates,
assumptions and judgments are affected by management's application of accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies", and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As discussed below,
our financial position or results of operations may be materially affected when reported under different conditions or when using
different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual
amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Management believes the following critical
accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Our ability to collect outstanding receivables
from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows. Accounts receivable are stated at an amount management
expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings
and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts after considering the
age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved. Balances that are collected, for which a credit to a valuation
allowance had previously been recorded, result in a current-period reversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting
a valuation allowance. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written
off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable in the current period. The actual amount of
accounts written off over the five year period ended May 31, 2018 equaled less than 0.1% of sales for that period. The balance
of the valuation allowance has remained at slightly less than $110,000 since May 31, 2017. Management does not expect the valuation
allowance to materially change in the next twelve months for the current accounts receivable balance.
 
Inventory
 
Inventory is stated at the lower of average
cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost.
 
Maintenance and other inventory represent stock
that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This stock represents certain items the Company is required
to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering.
 
This inventory is particularly sensitive to
technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product
lines, rapid technological advances and product obsolescence. Therefore, management of the Company has recorded an allowance for
potential inventory obsolescence. Based on certain assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time,
we determine the amount in the inventory allowance. If these estimates and related assumptions or the market changes, we may be
required to record additional reserves. Historically, actual results have not varied materially from the Company's estimates.
 
The provision for potential inventory obsolescence
was $60,000 and$180,000 for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Sales are recognized when units are delivered
or services are performed. Sales under fixed-price contracts are recorded as deliveries are made at the contract sales price of
the units delivered. Sales under certain fixed-price contracts requiring substantial performance over several periods prior to
commencement of deliveries, are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues are recognized
based on estimates of completion prepared on a ratio of cost to total estimated cost basis. Costs include all material and direct
and indirect charges related to specific contracts. Other expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Total estimated costs
for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of historical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates
or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the completion of the manufacturing process. Adjustments to cost
and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including
those arising from final contract settlements. These changes may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in
the period in which the revisions are determined. Any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations
in the period such losses are determined.
 
 
Table of Contents
 
If total costs calculated upon completion of
the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at completion used to calculate
revenue in a prior period, then the revenue and profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs used in
the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion. Historically, actual results have not varied
materially from the Company's estimates. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, 60% of total revenue recognized was accounted for
using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting while the remaining 40% of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made
to our customers. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, 66% of total revenue recognized was accounted for using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting while the remaining 34% of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made to our customers.
 
For financial statement presentation purposes,
the Company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred on uncompleted contracts. The asset, "costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings," represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, "billings
in excess of costs and estimated earnings," represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.
 
Income Taxes
 
The provision for income taxes provides for
the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial
statement basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets relate principally to asset valuation allowances such as inventory
obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty reserves, accrued vacation, accrued commissions
and others. The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between financial statement and tax depreciation. Deferred
taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.
 
Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent
on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become deductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance
to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation allowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax
assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable. The Company considers
future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a potential valuation allowance. In future
years the Company will need to generate approximately $3.2 million of taxable income in order to realize our deferred tax assets
recorded as of May 31, 2018 of $663,000. This deferred tax asset balance is 46% ($564,000) less than at the end of the prior year.
The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income are reduced. If actual results differ from estimated results or if the Company adjusts these assumptions, the Company may
need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities, which could impact its effective tax rate. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act) became law. It includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses, including corporate
tax rates, business deductions, and international tax provisions. Among the changes, the 2017 Act reduces the corporate rate from
34% to 21% for periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Because of the rate change, the Company recorded a non-cash write down
of deferred tax assets and recognized incremental deferred tax expense of $164,000 during the year ended May 31, 2018.
 
The Company's practice is to recognize interest
related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
The Company and its subsidiary file consolidated
Federal and State income tax returns. As of May 31, 2018, the Company had State investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$369,000 expiring through May 2024.

The Company's consolidated results of operations
showed a 5% decrease in net revenues and a decrease in net income of 81%. Revenues recorded in the current period for long-term
construction projects (“Project(s)”) were 13% less than the level recorded in the prior year. We had 50 Projects in
process during the current period compared with 55 during the same period last year. Revenues recorded in the current period for
other-than long-term construction projects (non-projects) were 13% more than the level recorded in the prior year. The number of
projects in-process fluctuates from period to period. The changes from the prior period to the current period are not necessarily
representative of future results.
 
The mix of customers buying our products changed
slightly from last year. Sales of the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, construction
and aerospace / defense. The Company saw a 12% decrease from last year’s level in sales to construction customers who were
seeking seismic / wind protection for either construction of new buildings and bridges or retrofitting existing buildings and bridges.
This was offset by a 27% increase in sales to customers using our products in industrial applications and a 1% increase in sales
to customers in aerospace / defense. The significant reduction in sales to construction customers was the result of several factors
including 1.) scheduling delays at customer construction sites, 2.) delays in receiving custom components from vendors, 3.) quality
issues from a subcontractor, and 4.) testing bottlenecks caused by delays in getting a new test machine operating. These issues
are resolved and management is optimistic that the sales volume will continue to improve. A breakdown of sales to these three general
groups of customers, as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

The gross profit as a percentage of net revenue
of 24% in the current period is seven percentage points less than the prior year. This difference is primarily due to 1.) a lower
total volume of product sales in the current period to cover non-variable manufacturing costs, and 2.) several projects in the
current period that were very competitively bid.
 
At May 31, 2017, we had 116 open sales orders
in our backlog with a total sales value of $21.6 million. At May 31, 2018, we had 121 open sales orders in our backlog and the
total sales value is $23.1 million. $8.8 million of the current backlog is on projects already in progress. $10.7 million of the
$21.6 million sales order backlog at May 31, 2017 was in progress at that date. 33% of the sales value in the backlog is for aerospace
/ defense customers compared to 56% at the end of fiscal 2017. As a percentage of the total sales order backlog, orders from customers
in construction accounted for 65% at May 31, 2018 and 42% at May 31, 2017.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased by 4% from the prior year. Outside commission expense decreased 6% from last year's level. Other selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by 8% from last year.
 
The above factors resulted in operating income
of $648,000 for the year ended May 31, 2018, down 78% from the $2,921,000 in the prior year.
 
The Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated
based upon current assumptions relating to the year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2018 is 34%, twelve percentage points more than the ETR for the prior year of 22%. A reconciliation of provision
for income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the Company's effective rate is as follows:

Stock Options
 
The Company has stock option plans which provide
for the granting of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers, key employees and non-employee directors. Options granted
under the plans are exercisable over a ten year term. Options not exercised by the end of the term expire.
 
The Company measures compensation cost arising
from the grant of share-based payments to employees at fair value and recognizes such cost in income over the period during which
the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Company recognized $125,000 and $178,000 of compensation
cost for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
 
Table of Contents
 
The fair value of each stock option grant has
been determined using the Black-Scholes model. The model considers assumptions related to exercise price, expected volatility,
risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average expected term of the stock option grants. The Company used a weighted average
expected term. Expected volatility assumptions used in the model were based on volatility of the Company's stock price for the
thirty month period immediately preceding the granting of the options. The Company issued stock options in August 2017 and April
2018. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. treasury yield.
 
The following assumptions were used in the
Black-Scholes model in estimating the fair market value of the Company's stock option grants:

Capital Resources, Line of Credit and Long-Term
Debt
 
The Company's primary liquidity is dependent
upon its working capital needs. These are primarily inventory, accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,
accounts payable, accrued commissions, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and debt service. The Company's primary
sources of liquidity have been operations and bank financing.
 
Capital expenditures for the year ended May
31, 2018 were $937,000 compared to $1,869,000 in the prior year. The Company has commitments to make capital expenditures of approximately
$530,000 as of May 31, 2018.
 
The Company has a $10,000,000 demand line of
credit from a bank, with interest payable at the Company's option of 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR rate plus 2.25% . There is no outstanding
balance at May 31, 2018. There was no outstanding balance as of May 31, 2017. The outstanding balance on the line of credit fluctuates
as the Company's various long-term projects progress. The line is secured by a negative pledge of the Company's real and personal
property. This line of credit is subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the bank and is subject to renewal annually.
 
The bank is not committed to make loans under
this line of credit and no commitment fee is charged.

Inventory, at $11,318,000 as of May 31, 2018,
is 1% less than the prior year-end. Of this, approximately 88% is work in process, 5% is finished goods, and 7% is raw materials.
All of the current inventory is expected to be consumed or sold within twelve months. The level of inventory will fluctuate from
time to time due to the stage of completion of the non-project sales orders in progress at the time.
 
The Company continues to rework slow-moving
inventory, where applicable, to convert it to product to be used on customer orders. There was approximately $148,000 of slow-moving
inventory used during the year ended May 31, 2018. The Company disposed of approximately $41,000 and $56,000 of obsolete inventory
during the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company combines the totals of accounts
receivable, the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC, to determine how much cash the Company will eventually realize from revenue
recorded to date. As the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two figures, the Company can anticipate increased
cash receipts within the ensuing 30-60 days.
 
Accounts receivable of $6,266,000 as of May
31, 2018 includes approximately $860,000 of amounts retained by customers on long-term construction projects. The Company expects
to collect all of these amounts, including the retained amounts, during the next twelve months. The number of an average day's
sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) increased to 88 days at May 31, 2018 from 36 days as of May 31, 2017. The DSO is
a function of 1.) the level of sales for an average day (for example, total sales for the past three months divided by 90 days)
and 2.) the level of accounts receivable at the balance sheet date. The level of sales for an average day in the fourth quarter
of the current fiscal year is only slightly more than in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The level of accounts receivable
at the end of the current fiscal quarter is significantly more than the level at the end of the prior year. The significant increase
in the level of accounts receivable caused the DSO to increase from last year end to this year-end. The primary reason for the
increase in the level of accounts receivable from last year end to this quarter-end was significantly higher billings for Projects
in May 2018 ($2.6 million) compared to May 2017 ($0.5 million). The Company expects to collect the net accounts receivable balance,
including the retainage, during the next twelve months.
 
The status of the projects in-progress at the
end of the current and prior fiscal years have changed in the factors affecting the year-end balances in the asset CIEB, and the
liability BIEC:

As noted above, CIEB represents revenues recognized
in excess of amounts billed. Whenever possible, the Company negotiates a provision in sales contracts to allow the Company to bill,
and collect from the customer, payments in advance of shipments. Unfortunately, provisions such as this are often not possible.
The $6,357,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2018 is a 7% decrease from the prior year-end. Generally, if progress billings
are permitted under the terms of a project sales agreement, then the more complete the project is, the more progress billings will
be permitted. The Company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months. 41% of the CIEB balance as of the end
of the last fiscal quarter, February 28, 2018, was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2018.
The remainder will be billed as the projects progress, in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts.
 
As of May 31, 2018, there are sales orders
for four projects that are not yet in progress. These projects average $2,198,000 each in value upon completion. This compares
to four such projects as of the prior year end with an average value of $259,000.

As noted above, BIEC represents billings to
customers in excess of revenues recognized. The $2,043,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2018 is in comparison to a $1,296,000
balance at the end of the prior year. The balance in this account fluctuates in the same manner and for the same reasons as the
account "costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings", discussed above. Final delivery of product under these
contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months.

Accounts payable, at $1,460,000 as of May 31,
2018, is 10% more than the prior year-end. This small increase is simply due to recent purchases. The Company expects the current
accounts payable amount to be paid during the next twelve months.
 
Commission expense on applicable sales orders
is recognized at the time revenue is recognized. The commission is paid following receipt of payment from the customers. Accrued
commissions as of May 31, 2018 are $983,000. This is 16% more than the $847,000 accrued at the prior year-end. This increase is
due to the increase in the accounts receivable, discussed above. The Company expects the current accrued amount to be paid during
the next twelve months.
 
Other accrued expenses of $1,413,000 increased
by 70% from the prior year level of $832,000. This increase is primarily due to increases in a.) accrued tax obligations, b.) accrued
postemployment benefits, and c.) customer prepayments. The increase in accrued taxes is due to more sales orders subject to state
sales tax. The accrued postemployment benefits are related to recently retired Company executives.
 
Management believes that the Company's cash
on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations,
capital improvements and share repurchases (if any) for the next twelve months.
