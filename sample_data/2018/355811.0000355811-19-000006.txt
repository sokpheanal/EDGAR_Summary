Results of Operations: 2018 to 2017
Net Sales.
 In 2018, Company net sales 
increased
 by 
$39.2 million
, or 
2%
 compared to the prior year.  Automotive net sales increased due to a 
6%
 increase in automatic-dimming mirror shipments, from 
39.3 million
 units in 2017 to 
41.6 million
 units in 2018, primarily reflecting increased overall penetration of automatic-dimming mirrors, more so within the Company's international markets than its domestic market.  International automotive mirror unit shipments increased 
7%
 in 2018 when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased penetration of both interior and exterior automatic-dimming mirrors to certain
 
European and Japanese automakers. 
Other net sales increased 
17%
 to 
$42.9 million
 compared to the prior year, as dimmable aircraft window sales increased 16% year over year and fire protection saw an increase in net sales of 18% year over year.
Cost of Goods Sold.
   As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold 
increased
 from 
61.3%
 in 2017 to 
62.4%
 in 2018, primarily due to annual customer price reductions that were not fully offset with purchasing cost reductions, as well as the Company's inability to leverage fixed overhead costs due to lower than expected sales levels.  Annual price reductions and fixed overhead costs independently impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 75 - 150 basis points.  These negative impacts were partially offset by the impact of purchasing cost reductions of 50 - 75 basis points. 
Operating Expenses.
   Engineering, research and development expenses 
increased
 by 
$7.4 million
 or 7% from 2017 to 2018, but remained at 
6%
 of net sales.  E, R & D 
increased
, primarily due to increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and launch of new business as well as development of new products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
increased
 by 
$3.8 million
 or 
5%
 from 2017 to 2018, but remained at 
4%
 of net sales.  The primary reason for the increase from 2017 to 2018 was due to increased staffing levels and travel expenses.
Total Other Income/(Expense).
 Investment income 
increased
 
$1.8 million
 in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to higher interest rates available for the Company's investable funds.   Other income – net 
increased
 
$3.7 million
 in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to
 
decreased interest expense associated with the Company's debt financing and adoption of ASU 2016-1, as discussed further in 
Note 2
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
18
Taxes.
  
The effective tax rate was 
16.1%
 for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 
23.5%
 the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction as well as the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017("Act").  In 2018, the effective tax rate differed from the new statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2018 from the prior year was due to the change in statutory tax rate as passed in the Act to 21% from 35%. 
Net Income.
 Net income 
increased
 by 
$31.1 million
, or 
8%
 year over year, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate on a year over year basis.
Results of Operations: 2017 to 2016
Net Sales.
 
I
n 2017, Company net sales increased by $115.9 million, or 7% compared to the prior year. Automotive net sales increased due to a 9% increase in automatic-dimming mirror shipments, from 36.1 million units in 2016 to 39.3 million units in 2017, primarily reflecting increased overall penetration of automatic-dimming mirrors, primarily within the Company's international markets. International automotive mirror unit shipments increased 15% in 2017 when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased penetration of both interior and exterior automatic dimming mirrors to certain European and Japanese automakers. Other net sales decreased 6% to $36.7 million compared to the prior year, as dimmable aircraft window sales decreased 13% year over year, which was offset by an increase of 2% year over year for fire protection sales.
Cost of Goods Sold.
   As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased from 60.2% in 2016 to 61.3% in 2017, primarily due to annual customer price reductions that were not fully offset with purchasing cost reductions, as well as the Company's inability to leverage fixed overhead costs due to negative product mix. Annual price reductions and fixed overhead costs independently impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 100 - 150 basis points. These negative impacts were partially offset by the impact of purchasing cost reductions of 50 - 75 basis points.
Operating Expenses.
  Engineering, research and development expenses increased by $5.5 million from 2016 to 2017, but remained at 6% of net sales. E, R & D expenses in 2017 increased 6% year over year, compared to calendar year 2016, primarily due to increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and the development of new business. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.0 million or 14% from 2016 to 2017, but remained at 4% of net sales. The primary reason for the increase from 2016 to 2017 was due to increased staffing levels and travel expenses, as well as approximately $4.4 million in certain previously announced retirement related expenses associated with the retirement of the Company's previous CEO and Chairman of the Board.
Total Other Income/(Expense).
  
Investment income increased $4.7 million in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to higher year-end mutual fund distribution income. Other income – net increased $5.0 million in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to increased realized gains on the sale of equity investments and decreased interest expense associated with the Company's debt financing, as discussed further in 
Note 2
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Taxes.
  
The effective tax rate was 23.5% for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 31.9% the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2016 and 2017 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction for both years, as well as the impacts of the Act. As a result of the Act, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by the Company’s transition tax. The total impact of the tax adjustments reduced the Company’s income tax expense during the year by $37.2 million. Pursuant to the guidance within SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), as of December 31, 2017, the Company recognized the provisional effects of the enactment of the Tax Legislation for which measurement could be reasonably estimated. 
Net Income.
 Net income increased by $59.2 million, or 17% year over year, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate as well and a 7% percent increase in revenue on a year over year basis.

Note 2
 of the financial statements.  The Company's current ratio decreased from 7.7 as of December 31, 2016, to 4.9 as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the repayment of $107.6 million of the Company's long term debt, and reclassifying the remaining $78 million as short term debt due to the maturity of the Company's term loan in September 2018.
Cash flow from operating activities was 
$552.4 million
, 
$501.0 million
 and 
$477.0 million
 for the years ended

Cash flow used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $173.7 million to $77.7 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to decreased investment purchases and capital expenditures during the year, as a result of allocation of funds to repay the long-term debt and for common stock repurchases.  Capital expenditures for the year ended 
December 31, 2018
, were 
$86.0 million
, compared with 
$104.0 million
 for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in production equipment purchases and building related costs.  Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $104.0 million, compared with $121.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to decreases in production equipment purchases and building related costs.

December 31, 2018
, increased 
$319.3 million
 to 
$719.3 million
, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to repurchases of common stock of 
$591.6 million
 during the calendar year 2018 compared to $231.4 million during the calendar year 2017.  Cash flow used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $169.4 million to $400.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $231.4 during the calendar year 2017 compared to $163.4 million during the calendar year 2016, repayments of long-term debt of $107.6 million in calendar year 2017 compared to $47.5 million during the calendar year 2016, and an increase of $7.7 million in calendar year 2017 as compared to calendar year 2016 to $108.8 million in dividends paid in calendar year 2017.

Accounts receivable as of 
December 31, 2018
 
decreased
 
$17.6 million
 compared to 
December 31, 2017
, primarily due to the timing of sales within each of the comparable periods.
Inventories as of 
December 31, 2018

 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounts payable as of 
December 31, 2018
, 
increased
 
$2.9 million

20
Current portion of long term debt as of 
December 31, 2018
, 
decreased
 
$78.0 million
 compared to 
December 31, 2017
, due to principal repayments on the Company's long term debt financing in connection with the September 27, 2018 maturity of the Company's debt. 
Management considers the Company’s current working capital and long-term investments, as well as its existing credit financing arrangement (notwithstanding covenants prohibiting additional indebtedness), discussed further in 
Note 2
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to internally generated cash flow, to be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future considering its contractual obligations and commitments.  The following is a summary of working capital and long-term investments:

Outlook
The Company utilizes the light vehicle production forecasting services of IHS Markit. IHS Markit current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar year 2019 are approximately 16.9 million units for North America, 21.9 million units for Europe, 13.3 million units for Japan and Korea and 27.4 million units for China. 
The Company currently estimates that top line revenue for calendar year 2019 will be between $1.83 and $1.93 billion. All estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the primary regions to which the Company ships product, as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix. The Company continues to see order rates and booked business that allow for these estimates despite very modest vehicle production increases in our primary markets.  Continuing uncertainties, including: light vehicle production levels; supplier part or material shortages; automotive plant shutdowns; sales rates in Europe, Asia and North America; challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including tariffs; OEM strategies and cost pressures; customer inventory management and the impact of potential automotive customer (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and supplier bankruptcies; work stoppages, strikes, etc., which could disrupt shipments to these customers, make forecasting difficult. 
The Company is estimating that the gross profit margin will be between 36% and 37% for calendar year 2019. The aforementioned gross margin estimate includes approximately $20 million in annual costs as a result of tariffs that were put in place in 2018 and proposed increases set to become effective in March 2019.  Historically, annual customer price reductions have placed significant pressure on gross margin on an annual basis.  Given the current revenue forecast and projected product mix for 2019, the Company believes it may be able to offset some of those annual customer price reductions with purchasing cost reductions and operational efficiencies, but will be limited in certain aspects due to rising commodity costs on certain electronic components and precious metal commodities, in addition to the aforementioned increased costs related to tariffs.
The Company also currently estimates that its operating expenses, which include engineering, research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between $195 and $200 million for calendar year 2019, increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and launch of new business as well as development of new products.  The Company is a technology leader in the automotive industry, with a focus on developing uniquely designed solutions that are highly proprietary.  The Company continues to make investments to maintain a competitive advantage in its current market as well as to use its core competencies to develop products that are applicable in other markets.
In light of on-going demand for our automatic-dimming mirrors and electronics, the Company currently anticipates that 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $90 - $100 million, a majority of which will be production equipment purchases. Capital expenditures for calendar year 2019 are currently anticipated to be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operating activities.
21
The Company also estimates that depreciation and amortization expense for calendar year 2019 will be approximately $105 - $115 million.
The Company is further estimating that its tax rate will be between 16.0% and 18.0% for calendar year 2019.
In accordance with its previously announced share repurchase plan and capital allocation strategy, the Company  intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in 2019 and into the future depending on a number of factors, including: market, economic, and industry conditions; the market price of the Company's common stock; anti-dilutive effect on earnings; available cash; and other factors that the Company deems appropriate. 
The Company is also providing top line revenue guidance for calendar year 2020.  IHS Markit current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar year 2020 are approximately 16.4 million units for North America, 22.2 million units for Europe,12.7 million units for Japan and Korea, and 28.6 million units for China. Based on these forecasts, the Company is estimating that revenue for calendar year 2020 will increase approximately 3% to 8% over current estimates provided for 2019 revenue.
Market Risk Disclosure
The Company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities, including foreign exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk.  Fluctuating interest rates could negatively impact the Company's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to other-than-temporary impairment adjustments on held-to-maturity securities (mark-to-market adjustments). 
The Company has some assets, liabilities and operations outside the United States, including multi-currency accounts, which currently are not significant overall to the Company as a whole. Because the Company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions, it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products.
Most of the Company’s non-U.S. sales are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars; during calendar year 2018, approximately 8% of the Company’s net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies (compared to 8% for calendar year 2017 and 7% for calendar year 2016). The Company currently expects that approximately 7% of the Company’s net sales in calendar year 2019 will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies. The Company does not currently engage in hedging activities of foreign currencies.
The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See the 
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
 below.

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates, assumptions and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations.  On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions.  Management also continually reviews its accounting policies and financial information disclosures.  
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in 
Note 1
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. However, these estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty. As a result, actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates, as is the case in any application of generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
• It requires management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of the estimate, and
• Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. Accordingly, revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services when it transfers those goods or services to customers. Sales are shown net of returns, which have not historically been significant. The Company does not generate sales from arrangements with multiple deliverables. The Company generally receives purchase orders from customers on an annual basis. Typically, such purchase order provide the annual terms, including pricing, related to a particular vehicle model. Purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. The Company recognizes revenue based on the pricing terms included in our annual purchase orders.  As part of certain agreements the Company is asked to provide customers with annual price reductions. Such amounts are subject to estimate and are accrued as a reduction of revenue as products are shipped to those customers. In addition, the Company has ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content, the cost of our products and other commercial factors. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers.
