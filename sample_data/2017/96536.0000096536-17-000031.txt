facts are "forward-looking statements." Statements accompanied or qualified by, or containing, words such as "may,"
 "will," "should," "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects,"
 "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "outlook," "forecast," "anticipates,"
 "presume," "assume" and "optimistic" constitute forward-looking statements and, as such, are not
a guarantee of future performance. The statements involve factors, risks and uncertainties, the impact or occurrence of which can
cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in such statements. Risks and uncertainties can include,
among others, fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions; variations in timing and amount of customer
orders; changing product demand and industry capacity; increased competition and pricing pressures; advances in technology that
can reduce the demand for the Company's products, as well as other factors, many or all of which may be beyond the Company's control.
Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results. The Company

Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates
 
The Company's consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of the Company's
financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported. These estimates,
assumptions and judgments are affected by management's application of accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies", and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As discussed below,
our financial position or results of operations may be materially affected when reported under different conditions or when using
different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual
amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Management believes the following critical
accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Our ability to collect outstanding receivables
from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows. Accounts receivable are stated at an amount management
expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings
and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts after considering the
age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved. Balances that are collected, for which a credit to a valuation
allowance had previously been recorded, result in a current-period reversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting
a valuation allowance. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written
off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable in the current period. The actual amount of
accounts written off over the five year period ended May 31, 2017 equaled less than 0.1% of sales for that period. The balance
of the valuation allowance has increased since May 31, 2016 to the current level of slightly less than $110,000. Management does
not expect the valuation allowance to materially change in the next twelve months for the current accounts receivable balance.
 
Inventory
 
Inventory is stated at the lower of average
cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost.
 
Maintenance and other inventory represent stock
that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This stock represents certain items the Company is required
to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering.
 
This inventory is particularly sensitive to
technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product
lines, rapid technological advances and product obsolescence. Therefore, management of the Company has recorded an allowance for
potential inventory obsolescence. Based on certain assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time,
we determine the amount in the inventory allowance. If these estimates and related assumptions or the market changes, we may be
required to record additional reserves. Historically, actual results have not varied materially from the Company's estimates.
 
The provision for potential inventory obsolescence
was $180,000 for each of the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Sales are recognized when units are delivered
or services are performed. Sales under fixed-price contracts are recorded as deliveries are made at the contract sales price of
the units delivered. Sales under certain fixed-price contracts requiring substantial performance over several periods prior to
commencement of deliveries, are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues are recognized
based on estimates of completion prepared on a ratio of cost to total estimated cost basis. Costs include all material and direct
and indirect charges related to specific contracts. Other expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Total estimated costs
for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of historical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates
or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the completion of the manufacturing process. Adjustments to cost
and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including
those arising from final contract settlements. These changes may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in
the period in which the revisions are determined. Any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations
in the period such losses are determined.
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
If total costs calculated upon completion of
the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at completion used to calculate
revenue in a prior period, then the revenue and profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs used in
the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion. Historically, actual results have not varied
materially from the Company's estimates. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, 66% of total revenue recognized was accounted for
using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting while the remaining 34% of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made
to our customers. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, 66% of total revenue recognized was accounted for using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting while the remaining 34% of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made to our customers.
 
For financial statement presentation purposes,
the Company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred on uncompleted contracts. The asset, "costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings," represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, "billings
in excess of costs and estimated earnings," represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.
 
Income Taxes
 
The provision for income taxes provides for
the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial
statement basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets relate principally to asset valuation allowances such as inventory
obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty reserves, accrued vacation, accrued commissions
and others. The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between financial statement and tax depreciation. Deferred
taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.
 
Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent
on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become deductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance
to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation allowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax
assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable. The Company considers
future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a potential valuation allowance. In future
years the Company will need to generate approximately $3.6 million of taxable income in order to realize our deferred tax assets
recorded as of May 31, 2017 of $1,227,000. This deferred tax asset balance is 27% ($262,000) more than at the end of the prior
year. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future
taxable income are reduced. If actual results differ from estimated results or if the Company adjusts these assumptions, the Company
may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities, which could impact its effective tax rate.
 
The Company's practice is to recognize interest
related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
The Company and its subsidiary file consolidated
Federal and State income tax returns. As of May 31, 2017, the Company had State investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$275,000 expiring through May 2023.

The Company's consolidated results of operations
showed a 28% decrease in net revenues and a decrease in net income of 45%. Revenues recorded in the current period for long-term
construction projects (“Project(s)”) were 28% less than the level recorded in the prior year. We had 55 Projects in
process during the current period compared with 61 during the same period last year. Revenues recorded in the current period for
other-than long-term construction projects (non-projects) were 29% less than the level recorded in the prior year. The number of
projects in-process fluctuates from period to period. The changes from the prior period to the current period are not necessarily
representative of future results.
 
The mix of customers buying our products changed
slightly from last year. Sales of the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, construction
and aerospace / defense. The Company saw a 34% decrease from last year’s level in sales to construction customers who were
seeking seismic / wind protection for either construction of new buildings and bridges or retrofitting existing buildings and bridges
as well as an 18% decrease in sales to customers in aerospace / defense and a 34% decrease in sales to customers using our products
in industrial applications. A breakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers, as a percentage of total net revenue
for fiscal years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

The gross profit as a percentage of net revenue
of 31% in the current period is four percentage points less than the prior year. This difference is primarily due to a combination
of a.) certain larger construction Projects in the prior year for which the Company was able to negotiate higher than typical selling
prices; b.) several smaller, aerospace / defense Projects in the prior year that have margins higher than the Company’s average;
c.) several export projects in the current period that were very competitively bid due to the unfavorable foreign exchange rates;
and d.) lower total volume of product sales in the current period to cover non-variable manufacturing costs.
 
At May 31, 2016, we had 115 open sales orders
in our backlog with a total sales value of $21.5 million. At May 31, 2017, we had 116 open sales orders in our backlog and the
total sales value is $21.6 million. $10.7 million of the current backlog is on projects already in progress. $11.7 million of the
$21.5 million sales order backlog at May 31, 2016 was in progress at that date. 56% of the sales value in the backlog is for aerospace
/ defense customers compared to 38% at the end of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of the total sales order backlog, orders from customers
in construction accounted for 42% at May 31, 2017 and 61% at May 31, 2016.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased by 24% from the prior year. Outside commission expense decreased 35% from last year's level. This fluctuation was primarily
due to the decrease in the level of sales from last year to this. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
by 19% from last year. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense from the prior period related
to the lower level of sales and operating results.
 
The above factors resulted in operating income
of $2,921,000 for the year ended May 31, 2017, down 49% from the $5,748,000 in the prior year.
 
The Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated
based upon current assumptions relating to the year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2017 is 22%, five percentage points less than the ETR for the prior year of 27%. A reconciliation of provision for
income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the Company's effective rate is as follows:

Stock Options
 
The Company has stock option plans which provide
for the granting of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers, key employees and non-employee directors. Options granted
under the plans are exercisable over a ten year term. Options not exercised by the end of the term expire.
 
The Company measures compensation cost arising
from the grant of share-based payments to employees at fair value and recognizes such cost in income over the period during which
the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Company recognized $178,000 and $151,000 of compensation
cost for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
The fair value of each stock option grant has
been determined using the Black-Scholes model. The model considers assumptions related to exercise price, expected volatility,
risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average expected term of the stock option grants. The Company used a weighted average
expected term. Expected volatility assumptions used in the model were based on volatility of the Company's stock price for the
thirty month period immediately preceding the granting of the options. The Company issued stock options in August 2016 and April
2017. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. treasury yield.
The following assumptions were used in the
Black-Scholes model in estimating the fair market value of the Company's stock option grants:

Capital Resources, Line of Credit and Long-Term
Debt
 
The Company's primary liquidity is dependent
upon its working capital needs. These are primarily inventory, accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,
accounts payable, accrued commissions, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and debt service. The Company's primary
sources of liquidity have been operations and bank financing.
 
Capital expenditures for the year ended May
31, 2017 were $1,869,000 compared to $1,939,000 in the prior year. The Company has commitments to make capital expenditures of
approximately $650,000 as of May 31, 2017.
 
The Company has a $10,000,000 demand line of
credit from a bank, with interest payable at the Company's option of 30, 60, 90 or 180 day LIBOR rate plus 2.5% or the bank's prime
rate less .25%. There is no outstanding balance at May 31, 2017. There was no outstanding balance as of May 31, 2016. The outstanding
balance on the line of credit fluctuates as the Company's various long-term projects progress. The line is secured by accounts
receivable, equipment, inventory, and general intangibles, and a negative pledge of the Company's real property. This line of credit
is subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the bank and is subject to renewal annually. In conjunction with this line
of credit, the Company agreed to the following covenants:

The Company combines the totals of accounts
receivable, the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC, to determine how much cash the Company will eventually realize from revenue
recorded to date. As the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two figures, the Company can anticipate increased
cash receipts within the ensuing 30-60 days.
 
Accounts receivable of $2,546,000 as of May
31, 2017 includes approximately $677,000 of amounts retained by customers on long-term construction projects. The Company expects
to collect all of these amounts, including the retained amounts, during the next twelve months. The number of an average day's
sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) decreased slightly to 36 days at May 31, 2017 from 40 days as of May 31, 2016. The
level of accounts receivable at the end of the current year is 36% less than at the end of the prior year. The decrease in the
level of accounts receivable was primarily due to a significant decrease in the level of sales from 2016 to 2017.

end of the current and prior fiscal years have changed in the factors affecting the year-end balances in the asset CIEB, and the
liability BIEC:

There is 1 fewer project in-process at the
end of the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year end and the average value of those projects has increased by 21%
between those two dates.
 
As noted above, CIEB represents revenues recognized
in excess of amounts billed. Whenever possible, the Company negotiates a provision in sales contracts to allow the Company to bill,
and collect from the customer, payments in advance of shipments. Unfortunately, provisions such as this are often not possible.
The $6,868,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2017 is a 25% increase from the prior year-end. Generally, if progress billings
are permitted under the terms of a project sales agreement, then the more complete the project is, the more progress billings will
be permitted. The Company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months. 33% of the CIEB balance as of the end
of the last fiscal quarter, February 28, 2017, was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2017.
The remainder will be billed as the projects progress, in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts.
 
As of May 31, 2017, there are sales orders
for four projects that are not yet in progress. These projects average $259,000 each in value upon completion. This compares to
five such projects as of the prior year end with an average value of $431,000.

As noted above, BIEC represents billings to
customers in excess of revenues recognized. The $1,296,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2017 is in comparison to a $1,464,000
balance at the end of the prior year. The balance in this account fluctuates in the same manner and for the same reasons as the
account "costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings", discussed above. Final delivery of product under these
contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months.

Accounts payable, at $1,329,000 as of May 31,
2017, is significantly (25%) less than the prior year-end. This decrease is due to a lower level of purchased materials required
to fill existing customer sales orders at the end of the current year that are not already in inventory, compared to the end of
last year. The Company expects the current accounts payable amount to be paid during the next twelve months.
 
Commission expense on applicable sales orders
is recognized at the time revenue is recognized. The commission is paid following receipt of payment from the customers. Accrued
commissions as of May 31, 2017 are $847,000. This is 24% more than the $684,000 accrued at the prior year-end. This increase is
primarily due to a few larger projects which, by the terms of the respective contracts, do not permit significant payments through
the current levels of completion. The Company expects the current accrued amount to be paid during the next twelve months.
 
Other accrued expenses of $832,000 decreased
by 70% from the prior year level of $2,734,000. This decrease is primarily due to decreases in a.) accrued tax obligations, b.)
accrued incentive compensation, and c.) customer prepayments. The decreases in accrued taxes and compensation are both related
to a decrease in revenue and earnings of the Company.
 
Management believes that the Company's cash
on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations,
capital improvements and share repurchases (if any) for the next twelve months.
