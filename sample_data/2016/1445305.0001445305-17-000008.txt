Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in “Section 1A. Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
Workiva provides enterprises with cloud solutions for improving productivity, accountability and insight into business data. Workiva created Wdesk, a collaborative work management platform for organizations to collect, link, report and analyze their business data. Wdesk’s proprietary word processing, spreadsheet and presentation applications are integrated and built upon a data management engine, offering synchronized data, controlled collaboration, granular permissions and a full audit trail. Wdesk helps mitigate risk, improves productivity and gives users confidence to make decisions with real-time data. As of 
December 31, 2016
, we provided our solutions to more than 
2,700
 enterprise customers, including more than 
70%
 of Fortune 500 companies
(1)
.
     Our scalable, enterprise-grade data engine enables users to collect, aggregate and manage their unstructured and structured data in Wdesk. We offer Wdesk solutions for a wide range of use cases in the following markets: finance and accounting, audit and internal controls, risk and compliance and operations. Underlying these solutions is our scalable, enterprise-grade data engine enables users to collect, aggregate and manage their unstructured and structured data in Wdesk.
We operate our business on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Customers enter into quarterly, annual and multi-year subscription contracts to utilize Wdesk. Our subscription fee includes the use of our service and technical support. Our pricing is based primarily on the number of corporate entities, number of users, level of customer support, and length of contract. Our pricing model is scaled to the number of users, so the subscription price per user typically decreases as the number of users increases. We charge customers additional fees primarily for document setup and XBRL tagging services. We generate sales primarily through our direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, customer success and professional services teams.  In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to augment our direct-sales channel with partnerships. Over time, we expect our partners to include technology companies, consultants, service providers and accounting firms. We expect our partners to support our sales efforts through referrals and co-selling arrangements, as well as expand the use of Wdesk through complementary technology offerings and software integrations.
Our integrated platform, subscription-based model, and exceptional customer support have contributed to a low rate of customer turnover while achieving strong revenue growth. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate was 
95.4%
 (excluding add-on seats) for the twelve months ended 
December 31, 2016
. 
We continue to invest in the development of our solutions, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our full-time employee headcount expanded to 
1,172
 at 
December 31, 2016
 from  
1,122
 at 
December 31, 2015
, an increase of 
4.5%
.
We have achieved significant revenue growth in recent periods. Our revenue grew to 
$178.6 million
 in 
2016
 from 
$145.3 million
 in 
2015
, an increase of 
23.0%
. We incurred net losses of 
$44.0 million
 and 
$43.4 million
 in 
2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
New customers
. We employ a “land-and-expand” sales strategy that focuses on acquiring new customers through our direct sales model and building our relationships with existing customers over time.  Acquiring new customers is a key component of our continued success in the marketplace, growth opportunity and future revenue. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force. 
Further penetration of existing customers
. Our account management teams seek to generate additional revenue from our customers by adding seats to existing subscriptions and by signing new subscriptions for additional business solutions on our platform. We believe a significant opportunity exists for us to sell additional subscriptions to current customers as they become more familiar with our platform and adopt our solutions to address additional business use cases. 
Investment in growth
. We are expanding our operations, increasing our headcount and developing software to both enhance our current offerings and build new features. We expect our total operating expenses to increase, particularly as we continue to expand our sales operations, marketing activities and development staff. We continue to invest in our sales, marketing and customer success organizations to drive additional revenue and support the growth of our customer base. Investments we make in our sales and marketing and research and development organizations will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments.
Seasonality.
 Our revenue from professional services has some degree of seasonality. Many of our customers employ our professional services just before they file their Form 10-K, often in the first calendar quarter. As of 
December 31, 2016
, approximately 
78%
 of our SEC customers report their financials on a calendar year basis. As our non-SEC offerings continue to grow, we expect our professional services revenue to continue to become less seasonal. Our sales and marketing expense also has some degree of seasonality. Sales and marketing expense is generally higher in the third quarter since we hold our annual user conference in September. In addition, we typically pay cash bonuses to employees in the first quarter, resulting in some seasonality in operating cash flow.

Total customers
. We believe total number of customers is a key indicator of our financial success and future revenue potential. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. Our customer is typically a parent company or, in a few cases, a significant subsidiary that works with us directly. Companies with publicly listed securities account for a substantial majority of our customers. 
Subscription and support revenue retention rate
. We calculate our subscription and support revenue retention rate by annualizing the subscription and support revenue recorded in the first month of the measurement period for only those customers in place throughout the entire measurement period, thereby excluding any attrition. We divide the result by the annualized subscription and support revenue in the first month of the measurement period for all customers in place at the beginning of the measurement period. The measurement period is based on the trailing twelve months. 
Our subscription and support revenue retention rate was 
95.4%
 at the 
December 2016
 measurement date, down slightly from 
December 2015
. We believe that our success in maintaining a high rate of revenue retention is attributable primarily to our robust technology platform and strong customer service. Customers being acquired or otherwise ceasing to file SEC reports have been the largest contributing factor to our revenue attrition.
Subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons
. Add-on revenue includes the change in both seats purchased and seat pricing for existing customers. We calculate our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons by annualizing the subscription and support revenue recorded in the last month of the measurement period for only those customers in place throughout the entire measurement period. We divide the result by the annualized subscription and support revenue in the first month of the measurement period for all customers in place at the beginning of the measurement period. The measurement period is based on the trailing twelve months.
Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons was 
107.4%
 at the 
December 2016
 measurement date, down from 
112.5%
 as of 
December 2015
.  As we pursue larger opportunities, we are seeing lengthening and more complex sales cycles.

Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions to our cloud-based software and the delivery of professional services. We serve a wide range of customers in many industries, and our revenue is not concentrated with any single customer or small group of customers. For each of the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, no single customer represented more than 2% of our revenue, and our largest ten customers accounted for less than 5% of our revenue in the aggregate.
We generate sales directly through our sales force. We also identify some sales opportunities with existing customers through our customer success and professional services teams and partners.
Our customer contracts typically range in length from three to 36 months. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in advance on a quarterly, annual, two-year or three-year basis, with payment due at the start of the subscription term. In  2015, we began to standardize our subscription term to one year, and over the next 24 months, we plan to convert a substantial majority of the remaining quarterly contracts with customers to a one-year term. Unpaid invoice amounts for services starting in future periods are excluded from accounts receivable and deferred revenue. Invoiced amounts are reflected as accounts receivable once we have initiated services with an offset to deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. At 
December 31, 2016
, deferred revenue was 
$97.5 million
. Estimated future recognition from deferred revenue at 
December 31, 2016
 was 
$76.0 million
 in 
2017
, 
$14.6 million
 in 
2018
, and 
$6.9 million
 in 
2019
.   
Subscription and Support Revenue
. We recognize the aggregate minimum subscription and support fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the subscription term, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our SaaS solutions has been granted to the customer, the fee for the subscription and support is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
Professional Services Revenue
. We believe our professional services facilitate the sale of our subscription service to certain customers. To date, most of our professional services have been related to SEC document set up and XBRL tagging, which are activities that we have undertaken thousands of times. Professional services also include consulting with our customers on business processes and best practices for using Wdesk. Our professional services are not required for customers to utilize our solution. We recognize revenue for our professional services contracts when the services are performed.        
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our professional services, customer success teams and training personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; the costs of contracted third-party vendors; the costs of server usage by our customers; information technology costs; and facility costs. Costs of server usage are comprised primarily of fees paid to Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. 
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions, travel, and stock-based compensation. Other costs included in this expense are marketing and promotional events, our annual user conference, online marketing, product marketing, information technology costs, and facility costs. We capitalize and amortize sales commissions that are directly attributable to a contract over the lesser of twelve months or the non-cancelable term of the customer contract based on the terms of our commission arrangements.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; costs of server usage by our developers; information technology costs; and facility costs.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; legal, accounting, and other professional service fees; other corporate expenses; information technology costs; and facility costs.

. Also, the cost of subscription-based software increased 
$0.2 million
 and other support costs rose 
$1.1 million
. Headcount growth in the professional services team was the primary driver of these software, support, and personnel-related costs. The decline in stock-based compensation during 2015 was attributable primarily to a one-time grant of stock options with immediate vesting in January 2014. Expenses related to subscription and support rose 
6.5%
 in the year ended

 compared to the same period a year ago, due in part to additional server usage of 
$1.3 million
, as customer usage of our platform grew. The modest growth in expenses related to subscription and support resulted from an initiative to moderate the growth of headcount devoted to customer success. Professional services expense expanded 
39.0%
 in the year ended 
December 31, 2015
 versus the same period a year ago due to an increase in full-time equivalents and employee compensation to handle the growing demand for services related to our newer use cases.

Research and development expenses increased

 in higher employee compensation, benefits, and travel costs. We continue to dedicate resources to enhance our Wdesk platform, which has resulted in higher headcount in research and development. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses increased 
$10.9 million
 in 
2016
 compared to 
2015
 due primarily to  
$11.5 million
 in higher employee compensation, benefits and travel costs. The increase in these costs was offset partially by a decline in professional service fees of 
$0.9 million
 related to consulting, recruiting and training. 
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses rose 
$4.0 million
 in 
2016
 compared to 
2015
 due primarily to higher employee cash-based compensation, benefits, and travel costs of  
$1.0 million
 and additional employee stock-based compensation of 
$2.8 million
. The increase in personnel-related costs was driven primarily by a rise in headcount to support the growth of our business. Higher stock-based compensation expense was driven primarily by restricted stock grants to executive officers in February 2015 and January 2016 with a vesting term of three years, as well as stock option grants to executive officers in February 2016 with a vesting term of three years.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased 
$6.3 million
 in 
2015
 compared to 
2014
 due primarily to higher employee compensation, benefits, and travel costs of 
$6.2 million
. In addition, other support costs 
57
Table of Contents
rose 
$0.6 million
 primarily due to higher headcount. Consulting fees decreased 
$0.7 million
, as we brought some previously outsourced consulting work in-house. In addition, we have been dedicating more resources to developing the next generation of Wdesk, resulting in higher headcount in research and development.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses increased 
$16.1 million
 in 
2015
 compared to 
2014
 due primarily to the expansion of our sales and marketing team as well as our marketing programs. Employee compensation, benefits, and travel costs rose 
$14.4 million
 due primarily to higher headcount in sales and marketing. Advertising costs grew by 
$0.6 million
 in connection with higher spending on brand marketing and marketing our new solutions. Professional service fees increased 
$1.3 million
 due primarily to consulting fees and additional recruiting and training costs associated with an expansion of our salesforce. 
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased 
$8.9 million
 in 
2015
 compared to 
2014
 due partially to higher cash-based employee compensation, benefits, and travel costs of 
$2.7 million
 and additional employee stock-based compensation of 
$3.4 million
. Also, the cost of subscription-based software climbed 
$0.7 million
 and other support costs rose 
$0.9 million
. The increase in software, support and personnel-related costs was driven primarily by additional headcount to support the growth of our business. In addition, outside service fees expanded 
$0.7 million
 due primarily to increased accounting fees from operating as a public company. An increase in stock-based compensation of 
$1.2 million
 from restricted stock grants made to our Board of Directors with a one-year vesting term was largely offset by a decline of 
$1.1 million
 in stock-based compensation due primarily to a one-time grant with immediate vesting terms made to a consultant in 2014.

As of 
December 31, 2016
, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled 
$62.7 million
. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds of our initial public offering, private placements of equity, debt that was settled in equity and cash from operating activities. We have generated significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities as reflected in our accumulated deficit and consolidated statements of cash flows. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and may incur negative cash flows from operations in the future. As a result, we may require additional capital resources to continue to grow our business. We believe that current cash and cash equivalents, cash to be received from existing and new customers, and availability under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.
In August 2014, we entered into a $15.0 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. Borrowing capacity is equal to the most recent month’s subscription and support revenue multiplied by a percentage that adjusts based on the prior quarter’s customer retention rate. The credit facility can be used to fund working capital and general business requirements. The credit facility is secured by all of our assets, has first priority over our other debt obligations, and requires us to maintain certain financial covenants, including 
59
Table of Contents
the maintenance of at least $5.0 million of cash on hand or unused borrowing capacity. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and liens, effect changes in management and enter into new businesses. The credit facility has a variable interest rate equal to the bank’s prime lending rate with interest payable monthly and the principal balance due at maturity. We amended the credit facility in April 2016 to extend the maturity date to August 2018. No amount was outstanding under the credit facility as of 
December 31, 2016
.
Pursuant to the credit facility, letters of credit totaling $2.3 million were outstanding at 
December 31, 2015
. These letters of credit, which did not reduce availability under the credit facility, were issued as security for two forgivable loans. The $2.3 million outstanding letters of credit remaining at December 31, 2015 were canceled in the first quarter of 2016 as all contingencies related to a forgivable loan were resolved. No letters of credit were outstanding at 
December 31, 2016
. 
Operating Activities
For the year ended 
December 31, 2016
, cash used in operating activities was 
$10.4 million
. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during the period were our net loss of 
$44.0 million
, adjusted for non-cash charges of 
$3.8 million
 for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, 
$14.2 million
 of stock-based compensation, and 
$1.1 million
 for recognition of other income from government grants. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a 
$7.1 million
 increase in accounts receivable, a 
$0.7 million
 increase in other receivables, a 
$5.5 million
 increase in prepaid expenses, and a 
$3.9 million
 decrease in accounts payable, offset by a 
$34.2 million
 increase in deferred revenue. Short-term deferred revenue from subscription and support contracts increased 
$18.9 million
 from 
December 31, 2015
 to 
December 31, 2016
. Long-term deferred revenue from subscription and support contracts increased by 
$13.8 million
 from 
December 31, 2015
 to 
December 31, 2016
. Short-term deferred revenue from professional services increased by 
$1.4 million
 from 
December 31, 2015
 to 
December 31, 2016
. Customer growth and contract renewals for longer terms accounted for most of the increase in deferred revenue. The increase in accounts receivable was attributable primarily to the timing of our billings and cash collections. The increase in other receivables was due primarily to timing of health care insurance reimbursements. The increase in prepaid expenses was due to purchasing server capacity upfront, an upfront payment for our 2017 annual user conference and to the timing of rent and travel payments. The decrease in accounts payable was attributable primarily to the timing of our cash payments.
For the year ended 
December 31, 2015
, cash used in operating activities was 
$21.6 million
 owing to higher operating losses, our planned reduction of incentives for prepayment on long-term contracts, and an increase in accounts receivable. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during the period were our net loss of 
$43.4 million
, adjusted for non-cash charges of 
$4.4 million
 for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, 
$11.0 million
 of stock-based compensation, and 
$2.4 million
 for recognition of other income from government grants. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a 
$7.3 million
 increase in deferred revenue, a 
$2.3 million
 increase in accounts payable, a 
$5.4 million
 increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a 
$5.1 million
 increase in accounts receivable and a 
$0.7 million
 increase in prepaid expenses. Short-term deferred revenue from subscription and support contracts increased from 
$36.7 million
 at 
December 31, 2014
 to 
$49.4 million
 at 
December 31, 2015
, while long-term deferred revenue from these contracts decreased from 
$13.3 million
 at 
December 31, 2014
 to 
$7.5 million
 at 
December 31, 2015
. The increases in accounts receivable and short-term deferred revenue were due primarily to new customers and to shifting a number of customers from quarterly contract terms to annual contract terms. As anticipated, long-term deferred revenue declined following our implementation of reduced incentives for long-term prepayments. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities were attributable primarily to 
60
Table of Contents
the timing of our cash payments. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to purchasing additional subscriptions to cloud-based software to support business growth and the timing of travel payments.
Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities of 
$3.8 million
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2016
 was due primarily to 
$1.3 million
 for the purchase of marketable securities and 
$1.9 million
 of capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of 
$7.2 million
 from the sale of marketable securities. Our capital expenditures were associated primarily with leasehold improvements, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure and work force.
Cash used in investing activities of 
$19.8 million
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2015
 was due primarily to 
$24.1 million

$1.8 million
 of capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of 
$6.5 million
 from the sale of marketable securities. Our capital expenditures were associated primarily with leasehold improvements, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure and work force.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities of 
$0.9 million
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2016
 was due primarily to 
$0.8 million
 in taxes paid related to the net share settlements of stock-based compensation awards and an aggregate 
$1.9 million
 in repayments on long-term debt and payments on capital lease and financing obligations, partially offset by 
$1.6 million
 in proceeds from option exercises.
Cash used in financing activities of 
$1.1 million
 for the year ended

We have entered into a lease agreement for land and an office building in Ames, Iowa, which was constructed in two phases. The lease term includes an initial 15-year term and three five-year extensions at our option because renewal was determined to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. As part of the lease agreement, the landlord was responsible for constructing the building in accordance with our specifications and agreed to fund 
$11.8 million
 for the first phase and 
$11.1 million
 for the second phase of construction. We were the developer of the project and responsible for construction costs in excess of these amounts. As a result of this involvement, we were required to capitalize the construction costs associated with the office building. The construction liability of 
$11.8 million
 was reclassified to a financing obligation and 
$17.1 million
 of costs capitalized during construction were placed in service during June 2013 for the first phase. Upon completion of the second phase of the project, the construction liability of 
$11.1 million
 was reclassified to a financing obligation, and 
$19.9 million
 of costs capitalized during construction were placed in service during 2014. 
The lease contains purchase options to acquire the landlord’s interest in the land lease and building at any time beginning three years from June 2014 (the commencement date of the second phase of the lease). In addition, the lease requires us to purchase the building from the landlord upon certain events, such as a change in control. The purchase options were deemed to be fair value at the inception of the lease. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, provision for income taxes and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.
Revenue Recognition
We commence revenue recognition for subscriptions to our cloud solutions and professional services when all of the following criteria are met:
•
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
•
The service has been or is being provided to the customer;
•
Collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and
•
The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. Collateral is not requested from the customer. If it is determined that the collection of a fee is not probable, the revenue is deferred until collection becomes probable, which is generally upon the receipt of cash.
Subscription and Support Revenue 
We recognize the aggregate minimum subscription and support fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the subscription term, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, access to our SaaS solutions has been granted to the customer, the fee for the subscription and support is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
Professional Services Revenue 
Our professional services are not required for customers to utilize our solution. We recognize revenue for our professional services contracts when the services are performed.        
Our professional services revenue is higher in the first calendar quarter because many of our customers employ our professional services just before they file their Form 10-K. 
Multiple Deliverable Arrangements 
For arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. For deliverables that have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and recognize revenue for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. 
Subscription contracts have standalone value as we sell the subscriptions separately. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription services, we consider the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and 
63
Table of Contents
whether we sell our solutions to new customers without professional services. We have determined that we have established standalone value for our professional services. This determination was made due primarily to the ability of the customer to complete these tasks without assistance and the sale of services separate from the initial subscription order. Because we established standalone value for our professional services, such service arrangements are being accounted for separately from subscription services. 
When multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement fee to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenue, if any. 
We determine our best estimate of selling price for our deliverables based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. We evaluate our best estimate of selling price by reviewing historical data related to sales of our deliverables, including comparing the percentages of our contract prices to our list prices. We also may consider several other data points in our evaluation, including the size of our arrangements, length of term, the cloud solutions sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within our arrangements. 
While changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements of the arrangement could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period, these changes have not historically been significant
 
because our recurring revenue is primarily subscription and support revenue.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date or reporting date, if required to be remeasured under the guidance. We utilize stock-based compensation in the form of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and options to purchase Class A common stock. The fair value of each stock option award is determined at the date of grant by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of each restricted stock award is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of these awards is recognized as an expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight line basis over the requisite service period.
All stock-based awards made since the date of our initial public offering have been for Class A common stock. All references to common stock in this “Stock-Based Compensation” section are to our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, as applicable.
Our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock (for periods prior to our initial public offering), the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of 
64
Table of Contents
management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
These assumptions are estimated as follows:
•
Fair Value of Our Common Stock:
 The fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. 
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate:
 We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury STRIPS with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
•
Expected Term: 
We estimate the expected term using the simplified method due to the lack of historical exercise activity for our company. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award.
•
Volatility: 
Due to the limited trading history of our common stock, we estimate volatility for option grants by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period immediately preceding the option grant for a term that is approximately equal to the options’ expected life. 
•
Dividend yield: 
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our unvested restricted stock and options granted during each of the periods indicated below:
