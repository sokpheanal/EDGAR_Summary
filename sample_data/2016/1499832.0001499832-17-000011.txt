Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following management’s discussion and analysis ("MD&A") is intended to provide the reader with an overall understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and sources and uses of cash. This section also includes general information about our business and a discussion of our management’s analysis of certain trends, risks and opportunities in our industry. In addition, we also provide a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements and our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
We use the term "Transactions" to refer to all material acquisitions and divestitures that were completed from January 1, 
2014
 to 
December 31, 2016
. The Transactions include, but are not limited to, the acquisition of NAME and the Tower Sale, which closed on September 1, 2015 and the acquisition of WE Fest, which closed on October 31, 2014.  The Transactions are described in more detail in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We use the term "pro forma" in this section to refer to results that include the Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 
2014
. 
Format of Presentation
Townsquare is a media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company, principally focused on small and mid-sized markets across the United States. Our assets include market leading radio stations, live events, and digital, mobile, video and social media properties. Our integrated and diversified product and service offerings, which we refer to as 
Townsquare Everywhere
, enable local, regional and national advertisers to target audience engagement across multiple platforms, including on-air, online and at live events. We believe our 
Townsquare Everywhere
 capabilities, combined with our leading market position in small and mid-sized markets, enable us to generate higher total net revenue per audience member than radio station owners focused on larger markets.
Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. We have two reportable segments, Local Marketing Solutions, which provides broadcast and digital products and solutions to advertisers and businesses within our local markets, and Entertainment, which provides live event experiences and music and lifestyle content directly to consumers, and promotion, advertising and product activations to local and national advertisers. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, we reported our results in two reportable segments, Local Advertising and Live Events, and reported the remainder of our business in our Other Media and Entertainment category. The prior Local Advertising segment, together with our digital marketing and e-commerce solutions, which were previously part of the Other Media and Entertainment category, are now reported within Local Marketing Solutions.  The prior Live Events segment, together with our national digital assets which were previously part of the Other Media and Entertainment category, are now reported within Entertainment.  We redefined our reportable segments to more closely align with how our businesses have evolved over time, allocating our locally-focused products and services to our Local Marketing Solutions segment and our events and related production products and services to the Entertainment segment.  This reflects how management currently reviews our performance and assesses the allocation of resources.  The new segment presentation has been applied retrospectively to our segment financial information but did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Local Marketing Solutions
Our Local Marketing Solutions segment is composed of 
312
 owned and operated radio stations and over 
325
 owned and operated local websites serving 
66
 small and mid-sized markets, a digital marketing solutions offering and an e-commerce offering.  Almost all of our radio stations have local companion websites that utilize the station brands and are populated with proprietary, original content created or curated by our local media personalities.   
Our primary source of Local Marketing Solutions net revenue is the sale of advertising on our radio stations, local companion websites, radio stations’ online streams and mobile applications. Our sales of advertisements are primarily affected by the demand for advertising from local, regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates we charge. Advertising demand and rates are based primarily on our ability to attract audiences to our various products in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, as measured principally by various services on a periodic basis. We endeavor to develop strong audience loyalty and believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations and websites helps 
44
to insulate our radio stations and websites from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format. We believe that the sale of our online and mobile advertisements, which currently have rates per advertisement that are less than those of terrestrial radio advertisements, has not negatively impacted our terrestrial radio advertising net revenue. Should a significant and sudden shift in demand for these products toward online and mobile occur, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to increase rates accordingly. However, we believe that as a result of our strong brands and quality online and mobile offerings we are well positioned to increase rates as demand increases for these products.
Within our Local Marketing Solutions segment we offer digital marketing solutions, on a subscription basis, to small and mid-sized local and regional businesses in small and mid-sized markets across the United States, including the markets in which we operate radio stations.  Our digital marketing solutions, offered under the brand name Townsquare Interactive, include traditional and mobile-enabled website development and hosting services, search engine and online directory optimization services, online reputation management and social media management.
We strive to maximize Local Marketing Solutions net revenue by managing our advertising inventory time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand and by broadening our base of advertisers and subscribers. Our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our advertising inventory and, in general, we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory levels. The optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the platform and in the case of our radio stations and their online streams, the programming format of a particular radio station. Each of our advertising products has a general target level of available inventory. We seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our platforms, thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group.
Our Local Marketing Solutions contracts are generally short-term. In the media industry, companies, including us, sometimes utilize barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging, instead of cash. Barter revenue was 
$13.1 million
, 
$16.4 million
 and 
$24.4 million
 for the years ended 
December 31,
 
2014
, 
2015
 and 
2016
, respectively. Barter expense was 
$12.0 million
, 
$14.2 million
 and 
$14.7 million
 for the years ended 
December 31,
 
2014
, 
2015
 and 
2016
, respectively.
Other sources of revenue within our Local Marketing Solutions segment include tower and other miscellaneous revenue.  We generate revenue from leasing space on our own tower facilities to communications companies and local authorities, as well as from other miscellaneous revenue sources.  As a result of the September 1, 2015 sale of 43 towers (see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), tower lease revenue is no longer a significant contributor to other revenue.
Our most significant Local Marketing Solutions expenses are sales, programming, digital, marketing and promotional, engineering and general and administrative expenses. We strive to control these expenses by closely monitoring and managing each of our local markets and through efficiencies gained from the centralization of finance, accounting, legal and human resources functions and management information systems. We also use our scale and diversified geographic portfolio to negotiate favorable rates with vendors, where feasible.
A portion of our Local Marketing Solutions expenses are variable. These variable expenses primarily relate to sales costs, such as commissions as well as certain programming costs, such as music license fees. Other programming, digital, engineering and general and administrative expenses are primarily fixed costs. Marketing and promotions expenses are discretionary and are primarily incurred in an effort to maintain and/or increase our audience share. 
Entertainment
Our Entertainment segment is composed of a diverse range of live events, which we create, promote and produce, including festivals, concerts, trade shows and other experiential events within and beyond our markets, and music and lifestyle content distributed through our owned, operated and affiliated national websites.
 
Our primary source of Entertainment net revenue is from ticket sales for our live events.  Our live events also generate substantial net revenue through the sale of sponsorships, ride tickets, food and other concessions, merchandise and other ancillary products and services. Live event ticket pricing is based on consumer demand for each event and the geographic location and target audience demographic of each event. Unforeseen events such as inclement weather conditions can have an adverse impact on our Entertainment net revenue. In certain cases, we mitigate this risk with insurance policies, which cover a portion of lost revenue as a result of unforeseen events including inclement weather.
45
Another source of Entertainment net revenue is national digital advertising, primarily display advertisements on our network of owned, operated and affiliated music and entertainment websites.  Our national digital sales team also sells product-activation sponsorship and advertising related to our live events. Our national digital assets are subject to general advertising trends as well as advertisers’ perception and demand for our products. A downturn in advertising spending or the economy could have an adverse effect on this net revenue. 
Certain expenses in our Entertainment segment are variable, including sales commissions, certain costs related to production and certain revenue sharing agreements with partners.  A portion of our revenue and expenses related to our NAME operations are denominated in Canadian dollars and expose us to translational foreign currency risk.  We have not historically hedged our exposure to this risk. 
    
Seasonality
Our net revenue varies throughout the year. We expect our first calendar quarter to produce the lowest net revenue for the year, as advertising expenditures generally decline following the winter holidays, and the second and third calendar quarters generally to produce the highest net revenue for the year. In addition to advertising revenue seasonality, our Live Events net revenue exhibits seasonality resulting in the third quarter being the highest revenue period, followed by the second, then fourth, then first quarter.  Large drivers of this seasonality are our summertime multi-day music festivals, and NAME's revenue, which is concentrated in the third quarter. During even-numbered years, net revenue generally includes increased advertising expenditures by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. Political spending is typically highest during the fourth quarter. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on net revenue generation until future periods, if at all. 
Macroeconomic Indicators
Our advertising revenue for our businesses is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ("GDP") as advertising spending has historically trended in line with, and in our experience often lags, changes in GDP.   According to the U.S. Department of Commerce estimate as of February 28, 2017, U.S. GDP growth for the year ended 
December 31, 2016
 was 1.6%.
LLC Conversion and Initial Public Offering
On July 25, 2014, Townsquare Media, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation (the "LLC Conversion"), and was renamed Townsquare Media, Inc. 
In the LLC Conversion, each unit and warrant to purchase units of Townsquare Media, LLC was exchanged for a number of shares of Class A, Class B or Class C common stock of Townsquare Media Inc. and warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock of Townsquare Media, Inc. The conversion was structured so as to retain the relative equity interests of each of the respective equity holders of Townsquare Media, LLC in Townsquare Media, Inc.  As a result of these exchanges, a one-time charge for share-based compensation of 
$37.6 million
 was recorded in 2014 operating results (
$24.9 million
 after the related tax benefit). 
On July 24, 2014, our shares began trading on the NYSE in connection with our initial public offering ("IPO").  Our shares are traded under the symbol "TSQ."  The IPO consisted of a total of 
8,923,333
 shares of common stock (including the subsequent exercise of an underwriters' option to purchase additional shares), at an offering price of 
$11.00
 per share. We received total proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of 
$88.1 million
. 
See to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act to hold a non-binding advisory vote of stockholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Impairment on Investment
During the 
year ended December 31, 2016
, there was objective evidence to indicate certain events have adversely impacted estimated future cash flows for one of our investments and as a result we recorded a

49
Other Expense (Income)
Interest expense, net is the major recurring component of other expense (income). Interest expense, net 
decreased
 
$1.9 million
, or 
5.3%
, in the 
year ended December 31, 2016
 as compared to 
2015
, primarily due to the refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness at more favorable rates on April 1, 2015, and the repayment of debt in 2016.  
On April 1, 2015, the Company issued $300.0 million of 6.5% Unsecured Senior Notes due in 2023 (the "2023 Notes") and entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, including a seven year, $275.0 million term loan facility (the "Term Loans") and a five year, $50.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver" and together with the Term Loans, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility").  The proceeds from the 2023 Notes and Term Loans were used to repay substantially all of our previous long-term borrowings. We recognized a $30.0 million net loss on debt extinguishment in connection with these repayments. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for information on the recent repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility.
The following table illustrates the components of our interest expense, net for the periods indicated.

year ended December 31, 2016
 primarily relates to state, local and foreign income taxes.

Net Revenue
Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $67.3 million, or 18.0%, as compared to 2014. This was primarily due to an increase in Entertainment net revenue of $59.3 million, or 107.4%.  The increase in Entertainment net revenue was composed of 
$19.5 million
 of growth from our existing business and 
$39.8 million
 of growth from acquisitions made in 2015 and the latter half of 2014, including their subsequent performance from the date of acquisition as further detailed below.
Local Marketing Solutions net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $8.0 million, or 2.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  The increase in non-political advertising of $13.2 million was offset by the decrease of political advertising of $5.2 million.
Entertainment net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $59.3 million, or 107.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  The increase was composed of 
$19.5 million
 of growth from our existing business and 
$39.8 million
 of growth from acquisitions made in 2015 and the latter half of 2014, including their subsequent performance from the date of acquisition.  The 
$39.8 million
 of growth related to acquisitions is attributable to (i) $10.3 million from the full-year effect of the 2014 acquisition of WE Fest, (ii) $27.8 million from the 2015 acquisition of NAME 
51
and (iii) $1.7 million from various live events acquisitions.  The 
$19.5 million
 of growth from our existing business was primarily attributable to increases in the attendance and revenue per attendee of our live events. 
Direct Operating Expenses
Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $64.3 million, or 25.4%, as compared to 2014.  As further detailed below, this increase was due to higher direct operating expenses in our Local Marketing Solutions and Entertainment segments.  
Local Marketing Solutions direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $9.3 million, or 4.6%, as compared to 2014. This resulted from increased investment in our digital products as well as slightly increased general and administrative expenses.  This was primarily related to increased costs in benefits and other headcount related expenses, as a result of our continued investment in additional headcount to support the growth of our business.
Entertainment direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $55.0 million, or 108.6%, as compared to 2014. The increase in direct operating expenses in 2015 offset much of the corresponding increase in related net revenue. This was primarily due to acquisitions made in 2015 and the latter half of 2014, as well as a heightened level of investment in infrastructure and new and existing events. 
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.7 million, or 4.1%, as compared to 2014. This increase primarily related to depreciation and amortization on property, equipment and finite-lived intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of NAME and the 2014 acquisition of WE Fest, which was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of capitalized software development costs.
Corporate Expenses
Corporate expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.5 million, or 1.8%, as compared to 2014.  This increase was primarily driven by increased costs in professional services to support our needs as a public company, as well as increased costs in headcount-related expenses including employee compensation and increased rent expense for office space to support the continued growth of our business.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the grant of immediately vested stock options in 2015 to certain employees under the 2014 Incentive Plan.  Stock-based compensation in 2014 was $37.7 million, $37.6 million of which was due to a one-time, non-recurring charge related to the conversion of certain units into shares of Class A and Class B common stock and stock option grants, both in connection with our LLC Conversion and IPO in July 2014. 
Transaction Costs
Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.7 million as compared to $0.2 million in 2014. Our transaction costs increased in 2015 primarily related to costs associated with the NAME acquisition, which closed on September 1, 2015. 
Impairment Charge, FCC Licenses
Based on the results of the Company’s 2015 annual impairment evaluations, the Company recorded impairment charges aggregating $1.7 million pertaining to FCC licenses in our Quad Cities and Grand Junction markets.  
Net Loss (Gain) on Sale of Assets
We recognized a $12.0 million net gain on the sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a $0.1 million net loss in 2014. The net gain in 2015 primarily resulted from the Tower Sale.
Other Expense
Interest expense, net is the major recurring component of other expense. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $10.5 million, or 22.6%, as compared to 2014. This decrease was due to a lower overall average interest rate on our debt and a lower level of outstanding indebtedness throughout 2015, as compared to 2014.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company refinanced substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness.  The Company paid $27.7 million in redemption premiums to the holders of its then-existing notes as a result of the early redemption.  In addition, the Company recognized a loss of $9.1 million and a gain of $6.8 million on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and bond premium, respectively.  These costs are reflected as Cancellation of debt in the table above.  
Provision for income taxes
We recognized a provision for income taxes of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate for the period was 43.6%. Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period, and can be influenced by many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes to the statutory rates in the jurisdictions where we have operations and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% in 2015 primarily related to foreign and state income taxes.
On September 1, 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests in NAME. As we acquired all of the outstanding equity of NAME, we inherited the tax basis of the acquired assets from the former owners. Therefore, our tax basis in the acquired assets is different from the GAAP basis of the same assets, which reflects estimated fair market value. We recognized an opening deferred tax liability in connection with the acquisition of NAME to reflect this difference between tax basis and GAAP basis. 
Prior to our IPO, for income tax purposes we were comprised principally of limited liability entities, which were not subject to federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, and certain corporations whose operations were subject to income taxes at the company level. Upon completion of our IPO and the LLC Conversion, all of our operations became subject to income taxes at the corporation level.

On a pro forma consolidated basis, net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $25.6 million, or 5.4%, as compared to 2014.  The increase was the result of a $17.2 million increase in Entertainment net revenue and a $8.4 million increase in Local Marketing Solutions net revenue as further described below.  Adjusted for the effects of fluctuations in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate, net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $30.4 million, or 6.4%, driven by an increase in constant currency Entertainment net revenue of $22.0 million, or 14.3%.
On a pro forma basis, Entertainment net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $17.2 million, or 10.8%, as compared to 2014.  The increase was primarily driven by increases in the attendance and revenue per attendee of our live events. On a constant currency basis, Entertainment net revenue increased by $22.0 million, or 14.3%, the difference attributable to changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate.
On a pro forma basis, Local Marketing Solutions net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $8.4 million, or 2.6%, as compared to 2014.

We fund our working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from our operating, investing and financing activities. Based on current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from our operating, investing and financing activities, together with funds available under our revolving credit facility, will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service 
55
and other funding requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of 
December 31, 2016
, we had 
$571.2 million
 of outstanding indebtedness, net of deferred financing costs of 
$8.0 million
, and based on interest rates in effect as of that date, we expect our debt service requirements to be approximately 
$37.4 million
 over the next twelve months. As a result of our recent repricing on debt, we expect annual interest expense savings of approximately 
$750.0 thousand
 based on the current principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we will be required to make an excess cash flow payment on the outstanding Term Loans of 
$6.3 million
 in the first quarter of 2017.  In addition, as of 
December 31, 2016
, we have 
$51.5 million
 of cash, and 
$59.6 million
 of receivables from customers, which historically have had an average collection cycle of approximately 45 days and $50.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
Our anticipated uses of cash in the near term include working capital needs, debt payments, other obligations, and capital expenditures. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments, other obligations, capital expenditures, and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions, increases or decreases in advertising spending, changes in the highly competitive industry in which we operate, which may be rapid, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Additionally, on a continuing basis, we evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions and divestitures to enhance our strategic and competitive position as well as our financial performance. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. 
We closely monitor the impact of capital and credit market conditions on our liquidity as related to our floating rate debt. We also routinely monitor the changes in the financial condition of our customers and the potential impact on our results of operations. 
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased 
$33.9 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 
$59.8 million
.  This increase was primarily due to a one-time cash payment of $27.7 million made on April 1, 2015 to lenders for the redemption of the Unsecured Senior Notes due 2019, that was not repeated in 2016. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to lower cash interest expense payments in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 
$19.3 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 
$25.9 million
.  This decrease was primarily due to a one-time cash payment of $27.7 million on April 1, 2015 to lenders for the redemption of the Unsecured Senior Notes due 2019 issued by our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary.  In addition, the company realized a net gain on sale of assets of $12.0 million during 2015 as compared to a use of 
$0.1 million
 during 2014. These decreases were partially offset by $9.3 million of deferred financing fees written-off in 2015. 
Investing Activities
Our investing activities primarily relate to payments made for capital expenditures and acquisitions consistent with our strategy to prudently invest in market leading properties. Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 
2014
, 
2015
 and 
2016
 was 
$39.7 million
, 
$71.8 million
 and 
$21.0 million
, respectively. Cash used in investing activities relating to capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 
2014
, 
2015
 and 
2016
 was 
$13.5 million
, 
$14.7 million
 and 
$20.9 million
, respectively. Cash used in investing activities relating to acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 
2014
, 
2015
 and 
2016
 was 
$26.1 million
, 
$76.2 million
 and 
$2.2 million
, respectively. Cash used in investing activities has been partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets for the years ended December 31, 
2014
, 
2015
 and 
2016
 of 
$0.4 million
, 
$19.1 million
 and 
$1.7 million
, respectively. 
Financing Activities
Cash flows used in financing activities in 2016 were 
$19.7 million
 and primarily consisted of 
$19.4 million
 of voluntarily payments made to repurchase and cancel our 2023 Notes outstanding at a market price below par, plus accrued interest. 
Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 were $54.4 million and primarily consisted of $620.0 million of proceeds from our new long-term borrowing arrangements, partially offset by $553.6 million of repayments of our existing debt and $11.4 million of costs related to debt financing.
56
Cash flows used in financing activities in 2014 were $26.7 million, and primarily consisted of (i) $88.1 million of net proceeds from our IPO, including the underwriters' overallotment shares, net of underwriters' fees and offering costs of $10.1 million, (ii) $123.7 million of debt repayments, (iii) $10.0 million of proceeds from the draw-down on our then-existing revolving credit facility to finance the WE Fest acquisition, (iv) $0.4 million in fees relating to debt financing costs, (v) $0.5 million of equity distributions and (v) $0.2 million of repayments for our capitalized lease obligations.
On July 24, 2014, our shares began trading on the NYSE in connection with our IPO of 
8,333,333
 shares of common stock, at an offering price of 
$11.00
 per share. We received proceeds from the IPO of 
$82.1 million
, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 
$6.4 million
 and offering expenses of 
$3.2 million
. Subsequently, on August 15, 2014, the underwriters of our IPO partially exercised their option to purchase additional shares electing to purchase 
590,000
 shares of Class A common stock at the offering price of 
$11.00
 per share. We recognized net incremental proceeds of approximately 
$6.0 million
, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 
$0.5 million
.  We used substantially all of the net proceeds, together with $37.0 million of cash on hand, to repay $90.0 million of our incremental term loans and $32.2 million of our Senior PIK Notes, representing the entire outstanding balances at that time.  
Financing Arrangements
On April 1, 2015, the Company issued 
$300.0 million
 of 
6.5%
 Unsecured Senior Notes due in 2023 (the "2023 Notes") and entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, including a seven year, 
$275.0 million
 term loan facility (the "Term Loan") and a five year, 
$50.0 million
 revolving credit facility (the "Revolver" and together with the Term Loan, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The Term Loan has an initial interest rate of 
4.25%
 (based on current LIBOR levels, a 
1%
 LIBOR floor and an applicable margin of 325 basis points).  The Revolver has an interest rate based either on LIBOR and an applicable margin of 250 basis points, or an alternative base rate and an applicable margin of 150 basis points. The proceeds from the 2023 Notes and Term Loan were used to repay all previous long-term borrowings outstanding at that time. 
On September 1, 2015, the Company issued incremental term loans of $45.0 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the proceeds of which were used to partially fund the purchase price of NAME. Further, on September 30, 2015, the Company made a $20.0 million voluntary prepayment of borrowings under the Term Loan. The Company recognized a loss of $0.3 million on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with this voluntary prepayment.  The write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs is included in cancellation of debt in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 
$298.5 million
 of Term Loan borrowings, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the Company is in compliance with all terms and covenants of its borrowing arrangements, and has $50.0 million of revolving credit availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.  We expect our debt service requirements to be approximately 
$37.4 million
 over the next twelve months based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2016. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company voluntarily repurchased 
$19.9 million
 of its 
2023
 Notes at a market price below par, plus accrued interest and recognized a gain of 
$0.5 million
, which is included in other expense (income), net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The repurchased notes were canceled by the Company. The Company recognized a loss of 
$0.4 million
 on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the voluntary repurchases of its 
2023
 Notes, which is included in interest expense, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
On February 8, 2017, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Facility agreement to reduce the applicable interest rate on its Term Loan.  Under the amended Term Loan, the applicable margin has been reduced by 
25
 
basis points to
 300 basis points.  The LIBOR floor of 
1.00%
 
remains unchanged and a 
1.00%
 
prepayment premium will apply in the event any Term Loans are repriced, repaid or refinanced within six months of the repricing. All other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility agreement remain substantially unchanged. 
 
We have historically serviced our debt obligations from funds generated by operating activities. We believe that our cash balance, together with our remaining capacity under the Revolver and cash generated by operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pursue our strategy for the next twelve months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions.
Impact of Inflation
We do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent items. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies. These policies are important to the presentation of our operating results and financial position and require significant judgment or the use of estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize broadcast revenue for commercial broadcasting advertisements when the commercial is broadcast. We report net revenue net of agency commissions. We calculate agency commissions based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for advertisers that use agencies. We recognize live event revenue and other non-broadcast advertising revenue as events are conducted. We derive internet revenue primarily from the sale of internet-based advertising campaigns to local and national advertisers and we recognize it over the duration of the campaigns.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We reduce the carrying amount of accounts receivable by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the accounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our general allowance including historical data, experience, customer types, creditworthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of those or other factors expected to affect collectability. We charge off account balances against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
Acquisitions and Business Combinations
We account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC, Business Combination Topic 805. We allocate the total cost of acquisitions to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. In addition, we may establish liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to acquired liabilities and qualifying restructuring costs and contingencies based on assumptions made at the time of acquisition. We evaluate these reserves on a regular basis to determine the adequacies of the amounts.
ASC, Business Combination Topic 805 requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date’s fair value with limited exceptions and changes in the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including:
•
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred; 
•
noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as "minority interests") are valued at fair value at the acquisition date; and
•
restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date.
Intangible Assets
We consider our FCC licenses to be indefinite lived intangibles. We evaluate our FCC licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We evaluate the fair value of our FCC licenses at the unit of account level and have determined that the geographic market is the appropriate unit of accounting.  We determine the fair value of our FCC licenses using an income-based approach.
We evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Stock-based Compensation
We measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including employee awards, in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires assumptions including the fair value of our common stock, expected volatility, expected term of the award, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized as the equity awards vest. The calculated compensation expense is adjusted based on an estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest. We have early-adopted ASU 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

Income Taxes
Prior to our IPO, for income tax purposes we were comprised of limited liability entities, which were not subject to federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, and Townsquare Media, 2010, Inc., formerly known as Townsquare Media, Inc.  ("TMI"), a corporation whose operations were subject to income taxes at the company level.  Upon completion of the IPO and the LLC Conversion all of our operations became subject to income taxes at the corporation level.  Accordingly, 
59
the statements of operations for the periods prior to the LLC Conversion only reflect the income tax effect of the operations of TMI.  Following the LLC Conversion, as of July 25, 2014, we are a C corporation for federal and state income tax purposes.  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. 
We evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts.  Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.  When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. 
We follow the provisions of ASC Topic 740, 
Accounting for Income Taxes
.  ASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements.  ASC Topic 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosures and transition.  As required by the uncertain tax position guidance in ASC Topic 740, we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.  For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. 
Contingencies and Litigation
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable. We also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss that is expected to be material to our operations or financial results or are probable but not estimable.
